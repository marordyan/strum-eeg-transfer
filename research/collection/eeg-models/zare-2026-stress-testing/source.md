#### **Abstract** 

**Objective.** Pretrained EEG foundation models are increasingly proposed for clinical decoding, yet whether their reported gains transfer across populations or survive standard negative controls is unclear. 

**Approach.** We benchmark six models (LaBraM, EEGMamba, CBraMod, REVE, BENDR, and BIOT) on five clinical tasks across four benchmark datasets using frozen linear probing with leave-one-subject-out, subject-grouped, or explicitly identified recording-level splits. Targeted controls are applied to selected REVE findings: random initialisation, random features, label permutation, scrambled-label fine-tuning, and projection-method sensitivity. **Main results.** On Korean dementia (CAUEEG 3-way, recording-level), frozen REVE reaches 0 _._ 568 AUROC against 0 _._ 769 for classical features; the ordering holds on the cohort’s patient-disjoint held-out split (0 _._ 565 vs. 0 _._ 768). A linear probe distinguishes each tested pair of datasets from frozen REVE embeddings at or near ceiling (AUROC 1 _._ 000 at PCA-50; 0 _._ 9998 after restricting the input to 0.5–40 Hz and per-epoch z-scoring), whereas the same PCA-50 pipeline decodes Korean 3-way diagnosis at 0 _._ 528. These results show that dataset identity is prominent in the leading variance directions, without isolating recording site from hardware, preprocessing, population, or clinical composition. A randomly-initialised encoder also outperforms pretrained REVE on Korean dementia (0 _._ 659 vs. 0 _._ 570). On Alzheimer’s disease, Gaussian random projection and PCA of the same pretrained embeddings perform similarly (GRP-200 0 _._ 875 vs. PCA-200 0 _._ 860), showing sensitivity to the projection method but not testing pretraining itself; at the subject level, classical features nominally exceed REVE (0 _._ 878 vs. 0 _._ 867). The clearest controlled positive is cross-subject ictal detection on CHB-MIT ( _n_ =23; REVE 0 _._ 793 AUROC, +9 _._ 2 pp over a random-initialised encoder), where positives and negatives share recording sessions. 

**Significance.** The results show that conclusions about EEG foundation-model gains depend strongly on evaluation unit, dataset shift, comparator strength, and targeted controls. We provide a practical set of checks that can be applied where technically appropriate before interpreting a benchmark gain as transferable clinical signal. All experiments ran on consumer hardware (Apple M3, 16 GB) without cloud GPU access.

## **1 Introduction** 

Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most accessible, temporally resolved, and cost-effective modality for measuring brain activity in clinical settings. Despite these advantages, EEG-based biomarkers remain underutilized in clinical trials for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, where Phase II/III failure rates exceed 85% and the average cost per approved drug is $2.6 billion [1, 2]. A primary barrier is the difficulty of extracting generalizable features from EEG recordings that transfer across patients, recording setups, and clinical conditions [3]. 

1 

Foundation models, large neural networks pretrained on massive unlabeled corpora via selfsupervised learning, have transformed natural language processing [4] and computer vision [5] by learning transferable representations that generalize across downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In 2024–2025, this paradigm reached EEG, with several groups releasing pretrained EEG foundation models capable of cross-subject transfer on brain–computer interface (BCI) and clinical tasks [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. 

However, the field currently lacks systematic comparisons of these models under standardized evaluation protocols. Published benchmarks typically evaluate models on datasets from the same distribution as pretraining data, use varying evaluation protocols (fine-tuning vs. linear probing, within-subject vs. cross-subject), and rarely test on multiple clinical tasks simultaneously. A critical gap remains: while foundation models show strong frozen-probe performance on held-out subjects _within_ diagnosis families (seizure detection, Alzheimer’s screening), it is unclear whether this transfer generalizes to _clinically heterogeneous populations_ where recording practices, patient demographics, or disease etiology differ from the evaluation datasets. For pharmaceutical applications, this domain generalization question is essential: outcome-labeled clinical trial data often comes from distinct sites with different recording protocols and patient populations than the benchmark datasets. The AdaBrain-Bench [10] standardizes within- and cross-subject BCI and clinical evaluation, but with full fine-tuning as its primary strategy, a different set of four models, no non-Western cohort, and no negative controls; cross-population domain generalization and control-based validation therefore remain largely untested. 

### **1.1 Contributions** 

This work asks whether EEG foundation-model gains on clinical tasks survive a change of population and targeted negative controls. The results are mixed: frozen REVE performs poorly on the Korean CAUEEG dementia task, dataset identity is readily decodable from its embeddings, and the interpretation of several within-benchmark gains changes under stronger comparators or controls. Our contributions are: 

1. **Cross-population stress test on Korean dementia.** On CAUEEG 3-way dementia classification (recording-level; the cohort ships no patient identifier), frozen REVE lags classical features by _∼_ 20 pp (0 _._ 568 vs. 0 _._ 769; the binary HC-vs-Dementia frozen probe is 0 _._ 589). The ordering holds on the authors’ patient-disjoint held-out split (0 _._ 565 vs. 0 _._ 768), although the recording-level cross-validation gaps remain upper bounds because repeated patients cannot be grouped. 

2. **Dataset identity is prominent in frozen embeddings.** A linear probe separates ds004504 from CAUEEG frozen REVE embeddings at AUROC 1 _._ 000, including after projection to the top 50 principal components, whereas the same PCA-50 pipeline decodes Korean 3-way diagnosis at 0 _._ 528. All tested within-Western dataset pairs also separate at ceiling. A band-limited replication (0.5–40 Hz, per-epoch z-scored) remains at AUROC 0 _._ 9998. These probes establish readily accessible dataset identity, but do not isolate recording site from device, preprocessing, population, or diagnosis composition. 

3. **Targeted controls and stronger comparators.** Random initialisation tests pretrained weights against architecture; label permutation tests probe capacity; scrambled-label fine-tuning tests whether label correctness contributes to adaptation; and PCA-versusGRP compares dimensionality-reduction choices on the same pretrained embeddings. On Alzheimer’s detection, subject-level aggregation and stronger classical comparators remove the nominal epoch-level mean advantage. The GRP result is reported only as projection-method sensitivity, because both PCA and GRP operate on pretrained REVE features. 

4. **A controlled positive on ictal detection.** On CHB-MIT cross-subject ictal detection (held-out epilepsy patients, full _n_ =23 cohort), pretrained REVE reaches 0.793 AUROC 

2 

versus 0.701 for a random-initialised encoder and 0.505 for random features of the raw signal; the label-permutation probe yields 0.500. Negatives drawn from the same seizurecontaining recordings reduce session-level confounding, and the result is stable to a _±_ 30 s guard band (0 _._ 798) and separate seizure-free-recording negatives (0 _._ 787). 

5. **Six-model benchmark.** We evaluate LaBraM [6], EEGMamba [7], CBraMod [8], REVE [9], BENDR [12], and BIOT [13] under a harmonized core pipeline with documented cohort/model exceptions, subject-disjoint splitting where identifiers are available, and frozen probing. 

6. **Secondary findings.** No foundation model outperforms classical features in the specific 2-channel binary Sleep-EDF experiment; AD-vs-FTD remains difficult under the evaluated frozen probes; and stronger classical/nonlinear comparators narrow the CHB-MIT margin while eliminating the nominal epoch-level AD advantage. 

## **2 Related Work** 

### **2.1 EEG Foundation Models** 

Self-supervised pretraining for EEG was introduced by BENDR [12], adapting wav2vec 2.0 with contrastive learning. BIOT [13] extended this to multi-biosignal pretraining across EEG, ECG, and EMG. 

LaBraM [6] (ICLR 2024 Spotlight) introduced vector-quantized spectral tokenization with masked prediction, achieving strong transfer on emotion recognition and motor imagery. CBraMod [8] (ICLR 2025) proposed criss-cross attention to separately model spatial and temporal dependencies, outperforming LaBraM on AdaBrain-Bench. EEGMamba [7] (Neural Networks, 2025) demonstrated that Mamba-based state-space models [15, 16] achieve competitive performance to transformers at lower parameter counts. REVE [9] (NeurIPS 2025) introduced 4D positional encoding for native generalization across arbitrary electrode configurations, pretrained on 60,000 hours from 92 datasets and 25,000 subjects. 

### **2.2 Evaluation Protocols** 

Cross-subject evaluation in EEG is challenging due to high inter-subject variability in spectral characteristics, spatial topographies, and recording conditions [3]. Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation is the strictest protocol, ensuring the model has never seen any data from the test subject during training. Most published foundation model benchmarks use withindataset evaluation, potentially inflating performance when pretraining and evaluation datasets share distributions (e.g., both from the TUH corpus). The AdaBrain-Bench [10] established a standardized benchmark that _does_ include clinical tasks (TUAB normal/abnormal, Siena seizure, and sleep staging) with cross-subject results for each. Its scope differs from ours in five respects: it evaluates four models (BIOT, EEGPT, LaBraM, CBraMod), not REVE, LEAD, BENDR, or EEGMamba; it uses full fine-tuning as the primary adaptation strategy; its clinical tasks are anomaly and seizure detection rather than neurodegenerative or psychiatric diagnosis; it tests no non-Western cohort; and it runs no negative controls. Two of its findings corroborate ours: on clinical-monitoring tasks foundation models performed comparably to or worse than traditional models (on Sleep-EDF the best foundation model reached 69.47% vs. 69.55% for the best traditional model, consistent with our 2-channel sleep result), and linear probing consistently underperformed fine-tuning, leading its authors to conclude that current foundation models are not ready for direct generalization from frozen representations. 

**Benchmarks and critical evaluations of EEG foundation models.** A rapidly growing literature benchmarks EEG-FMs and questions whether their reported gains are robust. Reviews report that linear probing is often insufficient and that supervised baselines remain competitive [17, 18]. Controlled and multi-dataset benchmarks similarly report mixed results across tasks and

evaluation protocols [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Our study adds a Korean cross-population stress test, targeted controls applied to selected findings, and dataset-identity probes across the tested cohort pairs. 

### **2.3 Linear Probing for Foundation Models** 

Linear probing, training only a linear classifier on frozen pretrained features, is the standard evaluation protocol for foundation models in computer vision [14, 5] and NLP. It measures the quality of learned representations independently of task-specific adaptation capacity. For EEG, this protocol has been used in AdaBrain-Bench [10] but is not universally adopted. We use it as the primary evaluation throughout this paper. 

## **3 Methods** 

Figure 1 illustrates the evaluation pipeline. Raw clinical EEG is processed through a harmonized core pipeline with the dataset- and model-specific exceptions documented below, then passed through six retained pretrained encoders. Frozen embeddings are evaluated with task-appropriate LOSO, subject-grouped five-fold, or recording-level splits; adaptation experiments are reported separately. All experiments were conducted on a Mac M3 laptop (16 GB unified memory) without cloud GPU; EEGMamba’s CUDA-only Mamba2 selective scan was ported to pure PyTorch for CPU/MPS execution.

### **3.1 Foundation Models** 

Seven pretrained EEG foundation models spanning five architectural families were evaluated across all applicable datasets under a unified frozen linear probe protocol:

> _†_ BIOT pretrained on TUH, SHHS, CHB-MIT, and three additional biosignal datasets (EEG, ECG, EMG). CHB-MIT and TUH TUAB are in-domain for BIOT. 

**LaBraM** [6] (vector-quantized spectral tokeniser with a masked-token transformer) was loaded via braindecode [26]; its 128-channel position embeddings are linearly interpolated to each dataset’s channel count, following the standard Vision Transformer approach [27]. **EEGMamba** [7] uses bidirectional Mamba2 state-space blocks [16]. **Disambiguation:** we use the _pretrained_ model of Wang et al. ( _Neural Networks_ 192:107816; masked reconstruction; HuggingFace `weighting666/EEGMamba` ), _not_ the end-to-end multi-task classifier of Gui et al. (arXiv:2407.20254). We reimplemented its CUDA-only selective scan in pure PyTorch (all 117 pretrained parameters loaded), enabling CPU/MPS execution on Apple Silicon without NVIDIA hardware. 

**CBraMod** [8] uses criss-cross attention (separate spatial and temporal attention), pretrained by masked reconstruction on 9,000+ cleaned hours of the TUH EEG corpus. Its public checkpoint has 4.9M backbone parameters (8.1M with task heads); Table 1 reports the backbone count. **REVE** [9] uses 4D positional encoding (3D electrode coordinates plus temporal position) to handle different electrode layouts without interpolation. REVE-Base (69.4M parameters, 512-d, 22 layers) was loaded via gated HuggingFace access. Because it processes each (channel, timepatch) pair without spatial pooling, embedding dimension scales with channel count. Models are evaluated at native dimensionality except where noted; the Supplement compares PCA and Gaussian random projection as alternative dimensionality-reduction methods on the same pretrained embeddings. 

**LEAD exclusion.** LEAD [11] was not retained in the comparative tables because the released model family includes contrastive pretraining and unified supervised fine-tuning configurations, with ds004504 used in the downstream training collection. The exact exposure of the locally evaluated checkpoint could not be established sufficiently for a submission-grade held-out comparison. 

**BENDR** [12] (157M parameters) adapts wav2vec 2.0 contrastive coding to EEG; its Conv1d encoder (pretrained on 20 channels at 256 Hz, with 96 _×_ temporal downsampling) requires 21-channel inputs to be truncated and 19-channel inputs zero-padded with a dead channel. We caution that BENDR’s near-chance frozen-probe results are _confounded with a bandwidth and channel-count mismatch_ : the wrapper resamples our 200 Hz epochs back to BENDR’s native 256 Hz before inference, so the encoder runs at its pretraining rate, but the signal was decimated to 200 Hz and band-limited to 0.5–70 Hz upstream and therefore carries no content above 70 Hz; 18-channel bipolar inputs are additionally zero-padded with two dead channels (run at 200 Hz with truncation/padding vs. its 256 Hz/20-channel pretraining), so the attribution to its contrastive, fine-tuning-oriented objective is suggestive; a clean test would run BENDR at 256 Hz. 

**BIOT** [13] (3.2M parameters) is a multi-biosignal transformer (linear attention, 256-d) pretrained 

5 

on six EEG/ECG/EMG corpora including CHB-MIT and TUH; inputs are truncated to the first 18 channels. Because its pretraining includes CHB-MIT and TUH, its results on those datasets are in-domain, and ds004504 Alzheimer’s is its only fully out-of-domain evaluation here. **EEGMamba channel constraint.** EEGMamba’s patch embeddings use fixed channel-countspecific weight shapes that cannot be adapted without retraining; it is therefore evaluated only on the 21-channel (TUAB) and 2-channel (Sleep-EDF) tasks and excluded from the 19-channel (ds004504) and 18-channel bipolar (CHB-MIT) cohorts.

> _†_ Subsampled from 8,130; _∗_ from 28,636. Stratified per subject. _‡_ 5-fold CV. _¶_ For CAUEEG the tabulated figure is _recordings_ , not epochs.<sup>_∥_</sup> CAUEEG is 21-channel raw; all reported analyses use the 19-channel 10–20 montage after excluding EKG and Photic. Retaining those two channels raises apparent CAUEEG AUROC, because a linear probe can exploit cardiac and stimulation-marker variance that is not cortical signal; the 19-channel montage is therefore the appropriate basis for every figure reported here (Section 4.6). 

**CHB-MIT** [28]: Continuous scalp EEG from the full cohort of 23 pediatric epilepsy patients at Boston Children’s Hospital (all 24 CHB-MIT case files; case chb21 is merged into the chb01 patient it re-records, and chb12 is retained). Standard 18-channel double-banana bipolar montage, 200 Hz, 60 Hz notch. **Task: cross-subject ictal detection.** Positive epochs overlap an annotated seizure by _≥_ 50%; negatives are interictal segments drawn from the _same_ seizure-containing recordings, at a 1:3 ictal:interictal ratio (per subject). All seizure-containing recordings per subject are included (acquired by HTTP byte-range fetch of the ictal windows plus a spread grid of interictal windows, given the _∼_ 40 KB/s PhysioNet link). Because positives and negatives share the recording session, recording-session confounding is designed out, confirmed by _±_ 30 s guardband and all-files sensitivity analyses (Section 4.1). Verified absent from REVE’s pretraining corpus (the only PhysioNet sources were Siena and ICARE [9]); this is a genuine out-of-domain evaluation. 

**CHB-MIT methods notes.** (i) _No amplitude-based rejection_ : the Methods’ _>_ 500 _µ_ V peak-topeak rejection is disabled for CHB-MIT because ictal epochs are legitimately high-amplitude and would be selectively discarded (it removed 27 of 28 ictal epochs of a 113 s seizure in testing); the per-class rejection rate is therefore 0% for both classes and the 1:3 ictal:interictal ratio is exact. (ii) _Amplitude normalisation_ : per-epoch z-scoring (step 7, a pretraining-compatibility constraint since the foundation models expect normalised inputs) removes absolute amplitude, the single most discriminative property of an ictal epoch, from _both_ the encoder inputs and the relative-band-power classical features. This handicaps the classical comparator on ictal detection and, if anything, makes REVE’s margin conservative; an amplitude-aware classical baseline would be a stronger comparator and is not evaluated here. (iii) _Bipolar coordinates_ : REVE is run with the first 18 positions of its standard 10–20 coordinate bank (the generic-position convention used throughout), because CHB-MIT’s bipolar derivations (e.g. FP1-F7) have no 

6 

single 3D electrode coordinate; the 4D positional encoding is therefore approximate on this montage, and a bipolar-aware assignment (first-electrode vs. midpoint) is untested, a caveat that applies to the one task where REVE wins. 

**Label note:** All CHB-MIT subjects are epilepsy patients (pediatric intractable-epilepsy cases recorded during pre-surgical evaluation with anticonvulsant withdrawal); the dataset contains _no_ non-epileptic controls. Positive epochs are _ictal_ : they overlap an annotated seizure interval by _≥_ 50%; negative epochs are interictal segments from the _same_ seizure-containing recordings. The task is therefore **cross-subject ictal detection** (ictal vs. same-session interictal epochs, in held-out epilepsy patients), not detection of a persistent epileptic-brain trait and not sample-precise onset localisation from short windows, which is a harder, separately defined task. **TUH Abnormal (TUAB)** [29]: Clinical hospital EEG from Temple University Hospital, evaluation set. 253 subjects, 21 channels (10–20 system). Binary labels: normal vs. abnormal, annotated by board-certified neurologists. This dataset shares clinical population and recording protocol with the TUEG corpus used for CBraMod and LaBraM pretraining. Cross-referencing against the published pretraining dataset list [9], TUH is confirmed as the largest source in REVE’s pretraining corpus (14,987 subjects, 26,847 hours, 44% of all pretraining data). The REVE authors removed downstream evaluation data from pretraining, but distributional similarity remains. Consequently, _all six foundation models evaluated here_ should be considered in-domain for this evaluation, and TUAB results should not be compared directly with out-ofdomain results (CHB-MIT, Alzheimer’s). 

**OpenNeuro ds004504** [30]: Eyes-closed resting-state EEG recorded with 19 channels in the standard 10–20 montage. The dataset comprises 36 Alzheimer’s disease, 23 frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and 29 healthy control subjects; the binary AD-vs-HC task uses _n_ =65 (36 AD + 29 HC), the 3-way AD/FTD/HC task uses _n_ =88, and the AD-vs-FTD task uses _n_ =59 (36 AD + 23 FTD). Recordings were ICA-preprocessed. Binary classification: Alzheimer’s disease vs. healthy control. Evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation with zero subject overlap between folds. Verified absent from REVE’s pretraining corpus (cross-referenced against all 56 OpenNeuro datasets in [9]); this is a genuine out-of-domain evaluation. REVE’s pretraining on diverse clinical populations enables generalization to unseen cohorts, the intended benefit of foundation model pretraining, not data leakage. 

**Sleep-EDF** [31]: Whole-night polysomnographic recordings from 20 healthy subjects (14 retained after excluding subjects with fewer than 5 epochs of both wake and sleep classes). 2 EEG channels (Fpz-Cz, Pz-Oz). Original 30 s annotations (W, N1, N2, N3, REM) binarized to Wake vs. Sleep, then re-epoched into 4 s windows with majority-vote labeling. 

**CAUEEG (Chung-Ang University Hospital EEG)** [32]: Clinical EEG database from Chung-Ang University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea. The release provides recording-level dementia labels but no public patient identifier for grouped cross-validation. We therefore report recording-level cross-validation explicitly and use the authors’ patient-disjoint held-out annotation as a sensitivity bound. The cohort differs from the benchmark datasets in site, hardware, population, clinical composition, and dataset history, so no single source of shift is isolated. 

### **3.3 Preprocessing** 

EEG data was processed using MNE-Python [33] with a harmonized core pipeline and documented cohort/model exceptions: (1) resampling to 200 Hz, (2) bandpass filtering (0.5–70 Hz, FIR), (3) a notch filter at the regional mains frequency, (4) common average reference for referential montages, (5) epoching into 4.0 s non-overlapping windows, (6) artifact rejection before normalization, (7) per-channel z-score normalization within each accepted epoch, and (8) clipping at _±_ 8 standard deviations. CHB-MIT disables amplitude rejection because ictal epochs can be legitimately high-amplitude; BENDR is resampled back to 256 Hz after the shared band limit and uses channel truncation or padding; EEGMamba is run at 200 Hz. These departures from each 

7 

model’s pretraining pipeline are treated as limitations rather than evidence about architectural objectives. 

### **3.4 Classical Baseline** 

To quantify the marginal value of foundation model representations, we compare against handcrafted features: relative band power in _δ_ (0.5–4 Hz), _θ_ (4–8 Hz), _α_ (8–13 Hz), _β_ (13–30 Hz), _γ_ (30– 45 Hz) computed via Welch’s method [34]; Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, complexity) [35]; and Shannon spectral entropy. Total: 9 _× N_ ch + 2 features per epoch (spectral/temporal features plus hemispheric alpha asymmetry and frontal theta power).<sup>1</sup> Classifier: L2-regularized logistic regression with balanced class weights. 

Enhanced classical and nonlinear comparators add connectivity, entropy, detrendedfluctuation, wavelet, aperiodic, and nonlinear-classifier sensitivities. They are described in the Supplement and are used to test whether conclusions depend on an intentionally simple spectral comparator. The aperiodic exponent is treated as a putative physiological proxy rather than a direct measure of excitation–inhibition balance. 

### **3.5 Evaluation Protocol** 

**Frozen linear probing.** Each pretrained encoder is frozen (no gradient updates). A logistic regression classifier with L2 regularization (class ~~w~~ eight=‘balanced’, solver=‘lbfgs’, max ~~i~~ ter=1000) is trained on the extracted embeddings. Both regularization strengths were fixed a priori (specified before any results were examined, not selected per task or tuned to outcomes) rather than cross-validated: _C_ = 1 _._ 0 for the primary LOSO seizure and TUAB tables, and _C_ = 0 _._ 1 (the default of the shared cross-validation utility) for the Alzheimer’s and cross-population analyses. A post-hoc sweep over _C ∈{_ 0 _._ 001 _,_ 0 _._ 01 _,_ 0 _._ 1 _,_ 1 _._ 0 _,_ 10 _._ 0 _,_ 100 _._ 0 _}_ on REVE/CHB-MIT, REVE/ds004504, and CBraMod/CHB-MIT bounds the consequence of this choice: the ds004504 probe is optimal at _C ≤_ 0 _._ 1, gaining 2 _._ 4 pp over _C_ = 1 _._ 0, and the CHB-MIT ictal probe is _C_ -invariant (mean-fold AUROC 0 _._ 793 at _C ∈{_ 0 _._ 1 _,_ 1 _._ 0 _,_ 10 _}_ ). The ds004504 sweep was run on an earlier preprocessing of that cohort, so it bounds the sensitivity to _C_ rather than supplying comparable absolute values. No model ranking changes, so no comparative conclusion depends on the choice; the swept counterpart is reported alongside as a sensitivity value throughout. _C_ is fixed a priori rather than tuned in a nested inner loop; the sweep above bounds the consequence of that choice. Class imbalance is handled uniformly via sklearn’s ‘balanced’ class weights (no undersampling or oversampling). 

**Cross-subject evaluation.** CHB-MIT and Sleep-EDF use Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation. TUH TUAB (253 subjects) and ds004504 (65 subjects) use 5-fold stratified group cross-validation with zero subject overlap between folds. 

**Metrics.** Balanced accuracy (BA) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) are reported as mean _±_ standard deviation across folds. 

**Line-noise filtering.** Each included cohort is notch-filtered at its own mains frequency: 50 Hz for the Greek (ds004504) and Dutch (TDBRAIN) recordings, and 60 Hz for the Korean (CAUEEG) and US (CHB-MIT, TUAB, ds003490) recordings. Line-noise handling measurably affects results on ds004504, so the filtering state is stated wherever it bears on a comparison. The AD-vs-HC analyses (Table 5) and the band ablation apply the 50 Hz notch. The AD-vs-FTD analyses (Table 7) and the ROI-pooling ablation predate it and are reported unfiltered; their absolute values are not directly comparable to the AD-vs-HC ones. 

> 1 The tabulated classical baseline is the full 9 _× N_ ch + 2 set, including hemispheric alpha asymmetry and frontal theta power.

## **4 Results** 

The Supplementary Material records the secondary evaluations, exclusions, and provenance decisions. Unless explicitly identified as an adaptation experiment, metrics use frozen embeddings. The split unit is leave-one-subject-out for CHB-MIT and Sleep-EDF and subject-grouped five-fold for TUH TUAB and ds004504; CAUEEG is recording-level because that release carries no public patient identifier (Section 4.6). AUROC is the primary ranking metric; balanced accuracy is also reported at a fixed threshold. 

### **4.1 Cross-Subject Ictal Detection (CHB-MIT, 18 Channels, Full Cohort)** 

**Preregistered correction disclosure.** An earlier internal 18-subject cache produced a headline AUROC of 0 _._ 920. The correction preregistration committed to reporting that value alongside the rerun because the earlier pipeline used an incomplete cohort and a different negative-sampling construction. The present full-cohort, same-session ictal task is the confirmatory analysis; the earlier value is disclosed only to document the change in task and is not used in any comparison or conclusion. 

Table 3: Cross-subject ictal detection on CHB-MIT (LOSO, full 23-subject cohort). Frozen embeddings + in-fold PCA-200 + L2 logistic-regression probe; mean-fold AUROC _±_ SD. Positives overlap an annotated seizure by _≥_ 50%; negatives are interictal epochs drawn from the same seizure-containing recordings, so recording-session confounding is designed out (Section 4.1). 

|**Model**|**Architecture**|**AUROC (%)**|**Params**|∆**AUROC**|

All rows use the same in-fold PCA-200 probe on the full 23-subject cohort.<sup>_†_</sup> BIOT has CHB-MIT pretraining exposure, so transfer and memorisation cannot be separated. Among models without known exposure, REVE is nominally highest and is the model evaluated with random-initialisation, raw-random-feature, and label-permutation controls; LaBraM’s similar result was not subjected to those controls. BENDR is not interpreted mechanistically because its sampling-rate, bandwidth, montage, and channel-padding mismatches differ from its pretraining configuration. 

Four pretrained encoders exceed the classical point estimate (Figure 2), although BIOT has CHB-MIT pretraining exposure and therefore is not an out-of-domain comparison. REVE and LaBraM are nearly tied; only REVE was subjected to the targeted control analyses below. BENDR is near chance under this wrapper configuration, but the result is confounded by implementation mismatches and is not attributed to its pretraining objective. The paired fold comparison between REVE and classical is treated as descriptive because LOSO training sets overlap and the benchmark contains multiple model and task comparisons.

Figure 2: CHB-MIT cross-subject ictal detection on the full cohort. BIOT has CHB-MIT pretraining exposure; among models without known exposure REVE and LaBraM are nearly tied. Targeted controls were applied to REVE, not to every model. Error bars are fold standard deviations; the dashed line marks the classical baseline. 

**Interpretation note: cross-subject ictal detection with same-session negatives.** Positive epochs overlap an annotated seizure by _≥_ 50%; negative epochs are interictal segments drawn from the _same seizure-containing recordings_ , so the task is within-session ictal-vs-interictal discrimination generalised across held-out patients. Because positives and negatives share acquisition session, electrode state, medication level, and time of day, recording-session confounding is _designed out_ rather than merely acknowledged: the result is unchanged by a _±_ 30 s peri-ictal guard band (0.798) and barely moves when negatives are instead drawn from separate seizure-free recordings (0.787; sensitivity analyses in this section). The discriminative signal is therefore a genuine ictal spectral–temporal state (low-frequency rhythmic build-up and post-ictal slowing) that generalises across patients, rather than a stable trait of the epileptic brain or a session-level artifact. The 0.793 AUROC quantifies cross-subject ictal detection; it does not license claims about sample-precise onset localisation from short windows, nor treatment-response prediction, which are harder, causal tasks this benchmark does not test. 

**Targeted controls for the ictal result.** A matched random-initialized REVE tests pretrained weights against architecture; a raw-signal random-feature map tests a simple nonlearned representation; and within-subject label permutation tests probe capacity. Pretrained REVE exceeds both feature controls and the permuted-label probe returns to chance. Sensitivities using a peri-ictal guard band and negatives from separate seizure-free recordings give similar point estimates. These checks support a narrow cross-subject ictal-versus-interictal result for REVE; they were not applied to every encoder and do not establish sample-precise onset detection.

**All models are in-domain on this task:** LaBraM and CBraMod were pretrained on TUEG; EEGMamba was pretrained on TUEG; REVE’s pretraining includes TUH (14,987 subjects, 44% of corpus);<sup>_†_</sup> BIOT was pretrained on TUH. BENDR (TUH-pretrained) achieves near-chance performance (58.1%), consistent with its contrastive objective requiring fine-tuning. Results should not be compared directly with out-of-domain evaluations (CHB-MIT, ds004504). 

On this in-domain task REVE (69.4M) reaches the highest AUROC at 84.5%, and BIOT clears classical by 3 _._ 4 pp on 3.2M parameters, while LaBraM, EEGMamba and CBraMod all sit within a few points of the classical baseline. Parameter count alone does not order the models: BENDR is the largest encoder evaluated (157M) and is near chance (58.1%), consistent with its contrastive objective requiring fine-tuning. Because all models are in-domain here (Table 4), this result speaks to pretraining scale on subtle diffuse distinctions, not to cross-population transfer. 

### **4.3 Alzheimer’s Disease Classification (OpenNeuro ds004504, 19 Channels)** 

Table 5: Alzheimer’s disease vs. healthy control classification on OpenNeuro ds004504 (5-fold stratified group CV). Frozen embeddings + linear probe. These epoch-level values are secondary to the subject-level aggregation reported immediately below. 

|**Model**|**Architecture**|**BA (%)**|**AUROC (%)**|**Params**|∆**AUROC**|

> _‡_ BENDR: 19-channel data zero-padded to 20 channels (+1 dead channel) due to its Conv1d constraint. ds004504 is out-of-domain for the retained models. The epoch-level REVE–classical ordering reverses after subject aggregation; PCA and GRP sensitivities in the Supplement operate on the same pretrained embeddings and do not test pretraining. 

At the epoch level, several encoders have similar point estimates. This ordering is not clinically primary: after aggregating predictions to subjects, classical features are nominally ahead of REVE. Enhanced classical features and a spectral-feature MLP also match or exceed the epochlevel REVE value (Supplement). LaBraM shows embedding-level non-determinism on MPS, and EEGMamba is excluded from the 19-channel evaluations. 

**Classical baseline robustness.** Per-subject IAF adjustment lowers classical AUROC to 82.1% from 85.1% fixed-alpha within the same earlier, unnotched run. Because these values use a different preprocessing and regularization setting, they are reported only as an internally matched sensitivity and are not compared with REVE. 

11 

**Primary subject-level result.** Aggregating epoch probabilities to one score per subject, classical features reach 87 _._ 8 _±_ 7 _._ 9% and REVE 86 _._ 7 _±_ 6 _._ 8% subject AUROC under 5-fold group CV. The 1 _._ 1 pp separation is well inside the fold spread; there is no subject-level mean advantage for REVE. Subject-level balanced accuracy is 79 _._ 0 _±_ 4 _._ 0% for REVE and 78 _._ 1 _±_ 11 _._ 6% for classical; with only five folds, the dispersion difference is descriptive rather than a demonstrated stability effect. 

**Frequency-band ablation.** To localise which frequencies carry REVE’s AD-relevant variance, we bandpass-filtered each epoch to a single band, re-normalised within epoch and channel, re-extracted REVE embeddings from the band-limited signal, and re-ran the 5-fold probe. Subalpha (0.5–13 Hz) and low+theta (0.5–8 Hz) match or slightly exceed broadband performance (both 84.5% vs. 83.6%), while gamma falls to 61.8%, close to chance and 21 _._ 8 pp below broadband: REVE’s AD discriminability is concentrated in slow-wave frequencies below 13 Hz, consistent with the known neurophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (Figure 3, Table 6). 



Figure 3: REVE band ablation on ds004504 (AD vs. HC, 5-fold stratified group CV). Sub-alpha (0.5–13 Hz) and low+theta (0.5–8 Hz) retain the broadband pipeline’s performance, whereas gamma-only input falls to 61.8%. This localizes the frequencies used by this model and cohort; it does not establish an AD-specific physiological mechanism. The dashed line shows the epoch-level classical baseline (80.6%). 

Table 6: REVE band ablation on ds004504 (AD vs. HC, 5-fold stratified group CV). The broadband row (83.6%) is computed with the band-ablation pipeline, which re-normalises within epoch and channel, and so differs from the 82.8% of Table 5. Classical baseline: 80.6% AUROC. 

|**Band**|**AUROC (%)**|_±_ **std**|∆**vs broadband**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Broadband (0.5–70 Hz)|83.6|7.3|—|
|Delta (0.5–4 Hz)|81.1|7.5|_−_2_._5|
|Theta (4–8 Hz)|79.1|8.4|_−_4_._5|
|Alpha (8–13 Hz)|79.7|6.8|_−_3_._9|
|Beta (13–30 Hz)|76.6|7.3|_−_7_._0|
|Gamma (30–70 Hz)|61.8|9.9|_−_21_._8|
|Low+theta (0.5–8 Hz)|**84.5**|6.9|+0_._9|
|**Sub-alpha (0.5–13 Hz)**|**84.5**|6.9|+0_._9|



**Interpretation.** In this cohort and extraction pipeline, REVE retains AD/HC discriminability when the input is restricted below 13 Hz and loses performance with gamma-only input. This is a model-behaviour result, not evidence that high-frequency activity is biologically irrelevant or that the representation contains information beyond conventional spectral features.

### **4.4 AD vs. FTD Differential Diagnosis (OpenNeuro ds004504, 19 Channels)** 

Table 7: Cross-subject AD vs. FTD differential diagnosis on OpenNeuro ds004504 (5-fold stratified group CV). Frozen embeddings + linear probe. These analyses predate the 50 Hz notch applied to the AD-vs-HC results of Table 5 and are reported unfiltered, so their absolute values are not directly comparable to that table (Section 3.5). 

|**Model**|**Architecture**|**BA (%)**|**AUROC (%)**|**Params**|∆**AUROC**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Classical|LogReg|53_._7_±_6_._5|55_._0_±_9_._0|—|—|
|LaBraM|Transformer|56_._4_±_3_._3|58_._7_±_4_._0|5.8M|+3_._7|
|CBraMod|Criss-Cross|53_._9_±_2_._8|55_._5_±_3_._9|4.9M|+0_._5|

These analyses predate the 50 Hz notch used for AD-vs-HC and are not directly comparable with that task. 

All evaluated models show weak and variable discrimination on AD vs. FTD under the frozen probes. This result describes performance under the evaluated pipeline; it does not establish that the recordings contain no discriminative information or identify the biological reason for the difficulty. 

**ROI pooling ablation.** Extracting REVE token subsets by region gives full 64.7%, frontal 65.0%, posterior 60.0%, frontal+posterior 65.6%, and temporal 61.8% AUROC (Figure 4). ROI selection does not materially improve performance; whether sample size, label ambiguity, preprocessing, or representation is limiting cannot be distinguished here. 



Figure 4: ROI pooling ablation on AD vs. FTD (REVE frozen, 5-fold CV). Frontal, posterior, temporal, and combined token subsets do not materially improve over the full representation. The experiment does not identify which of sample size, labels, preprocessing, or representation limits performance.

### **4.5 Sleep Staging (Sleep-EDF, 2 Channels)** 

Table 8: Cross-subject sleep staging on Sleep-EDF (LOSO). Wake vs. Sleep. 

|**Model**|**Architecture**|**BA (%)**|**AUROC (%)**|**Params**|∆**AUROC**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Classical**|LogReg|**64**_._**8**_±_**12**_._**3**|**68**_._**6**_±_**14**_._**1**|—|—|

|CBraMod|Criss-Cross|63_._6_±_12_._3|68_._3_±_13_._8|4.9M|_−_0_._3|
|REVE-Base|4D Pos Enc|58_._2_±_9_._4|62_._3_±_12_._4|69.4M|_−_6_._3|



LaBraM and EEGMamba have sleep-domain pretraining exposure (SHHS or HMC in corpora; distributionaladjacent). CBraMod and REVE are OOD on sleep data. The negative result is therefore ambiguous for distributional-adjacent models: even with relevant pretraining, they fail to outperform classical features at 2 channels. 

None of the four foundation models beats classical on 2-channel sleep EEG: Classical 68.6%, EEGMamba 68.1%, CBraMod 68.3%, REVE 62.3% ( _−_ 6 _._ 3 pp), LaBraM 58.1% ( _−_ 10 _._ 5 pp). The two largest deficits belong to LaBraM ( _−_ 10 _._ 5 pp, 5.8M) and REVE ( _−_ 6 _._ 3 pp, 69.4M), while the two models closest to classical are among the smallest (CBraMod _−_ 0 _._ 3 pp at 4.9M; EEGMamba _−_ 0 _._ 5 pp at 3.3M), so the ordering here does not track parameter count. Fold variance is high for every model including the classical baseline ( _±_ 11.9 to _±_ 14.1 AUROC), reflecting subject heterogeneity across a 14-subject leave-one-subject-out evaluation rather than an instability specific to any one model. 

Two factors explain the failure. First, binarising the 5-class annotations (W/N1/N2/N3/REM) into Wake vs. Sleep discards the stage-specific spectral structure (spindles, K-complexes, delta synchrony) that foundation-model representations exploit. Second, the 2-channel differential montage (Fpz-Cz, Pz-Oz) lacks the spatial coverage positional encodings use; for REVE the compound names were resolved to single electrodes (Fpz, Pz), which may actively hurt its 4D positional encoding. The conclusion is specific to this binary/2-channel setup and does not preclude a foundation-model advantage in multi-class staging with _≥_ 19 channels. 

### **4.6 Domain Generalization Under Clinical Heterogeneity (CAUEEG, HC vs. Dementia)** 

The benchmark results above test REVE on publicly available datasets where pretraining data is either included in-domain or excluded from the pretraining corpus. A critical question for pharmaceutical applications is whether REVE’s frozen representations generalize to clinical populations that differ substantially from either reference dataset. To assess domain generalization under realistic heterogeneity, we evaluated REVE on CAUEEG (Chung-Ang University Hospital EEG) [32], a clinical EEG database from Seoul, South Korea (1,379 recordings from 1,155 patients; 21-channel 10–20 montage, 200 Hz). For the HC vs. Dementia binary task, MCI cases are excluded, yielding 770 per-recording embeddings (459 HC, 311 Dementia; one mean-pooled embedding per CAUEEG serial). **Protocol (recording-level).** CAUEEG contains more recordings than patients (1,379 recordings from 1,155 patients), but the public release carries no patient identifier: `annotation.json` and `annotation.xlsx` expose only the recording serial, age, and symptom labels, and the EDF patient-identification field is anonymised to `X X X X` in all 1,379 files. Patient-grouped cross-validation is therefore not constructible on this cohort, and every CAUEEG cross-validation figure reported here is a _recording-level_ 5-fold split over per-serial embeddings. Two tasks are reported. On the _3-way_ Normal/MCI/Dementia task ( _N_ =1 _,_ 187 recordings) the classical band-power baseline reaches 0 _._ 769 AUROC (LDA; 0 _._ 765 SVM-RBF, 0 _._ 761 LogReg) while frozen REVE reaches 0 _._ 568 (SVM-RBF), a _∼_ 20 pp classical advantage. On 

14 

the _binary_ HC-vs-Dementia task ( _N_ =770 recordings; 459 HC, 311 Dementia) frozen REVE reaches 0 _._ 589 (SVM-RBF on PCA(50)) while the matched binary classical band-power baseline reaches 0 _._ 894 (SVM-RBF; 0 _._ 895 LogReg, 0 _._ 897 LDA): a 30 _._ 5 pp classical advantage wider than the 3-way gap. A NARPS-style robustness sweep (probe family and 2/4/8 s epoch length; Classical-baseline robustness, below) never lowers the classical advantage below +12 _._ 7 pp (its minimum, from the 8 s-epoch _N_ =150 sub-analysis: classical 0 _._ 695 vs. frozen REVE 0 _._ 568). **Same-patient leakage bound.** The exposure this protocol leaves is real and quantifiable. The CAUEEG authors ship a `dementia-no-overlap.json` variant of their fixed split which, per the dataset documentation, excludes all patient-overlapping cases with training data from the validation and test sets; diffing it against `dementia.json` shows the training split unchanged and 65 of the 237 held-out recordings removed (27 _._ 4%), so on the order of a quarter of a held-out CAUEEG sample carries a same-patient partner in training. That diff is also the only public trace of patient identity, and it supports a direct bound: we trained each probe once on the authors’ fixed training split and scored it, unchanged, on three evaluation sets differing only in patient overlap, namely the full held-out set, its patient-disjoint subset, and the overlapping remainder. On the binary task (train = 616) the classical baseline reaches 0 _._ 919 AUROC on the 111 patient-disjoint recordings (LDA, bootstrap 95% CI [0 _._ 869 _,_ 0 _._ 962]; 0 _._ 917 LogReg, 0 _._ 879 SVM-RBF) against 0 _._ 935 on the full 154 — so the 0 _._ 894 recording-level CV value is not an artifact of same-patient repetition — while frozen REVE stays near chance (0 _._ 633 LogReg, 0 _._ 557 SVM-RBF). On the 3-way task (train = 950) the patient-disjoint classical value is 0 _._ 768 ([0 _._ 708 _,_ 0 _._ 822]), matching the 0 _._ 769 recording-level CV headline, against frozen REVE 0 _._ 565. The reversal therefore survives the only patient-disjoint evaluation this release permits. Two caveats temper it. First, same-patient repeats _are_ strongly identifying for spectral features and not for REVE: on the overlapping recordings alone the classical baseline reaches 0 _._ 978–0 _._ 991 (binary) and 0 _._ 840–0 _._ 868 (3-way) whereas frozen REVE does not benefit (0 _._ 479–0 _._ 543 across both tasks and probes), so leakage inflates the _gap_ by _≈_ 5 pp in both tasks. On this fixed split the classical-minus-REVE gap falls from 0 _._ 337 to 0 _._ 286 (binary) and from 0 _._ 252 to 0 _._ 203 (3-way) once the overlapping recordings are removed; the corresponding cross-validated gaps (0 _._ 305 and 0 _._ 197, Table 9) should likewise be read as upper bounds. Second, the authors’ annotation covers only train-versus-held-out overlap; repeat recordings lying entirely inside the training split are neither annotated nor removable, and the single fixed held-out sets (111 binary, 172 3-way recordings) give wide intervals. **Shared-split controls.** Real-label and scrambled-label adaptation use the same recording-level splits, making them paired with respect to split assignment, but representations may exploit repeated-patient structure differently; the confound is shared rather than cancelled. The patient-disjoint held-out analysis is therefore the relevant leakage sensitivity. CAUEEG also differs from the benchmark datasets in demographics, clinical setting, and diagnostic heterogeneity. 

**Classical baseline robustness.** To guard against the possibility that the classical AUROC advantage is a pipeline artefact, we conducted a sensitivity analysis across the accessible pipeline dimensions [39]. _Probe sensitivity_ (full _N_ =1 _,_ 187, cached features, recording-level 5-fold CV): classical AUROC spans 0 _._ 761 (LogReg) to 0 _._ 769 (LDA) to 0 _._ 765 (SVM-RBF), a total width of 0 _._ 8 pp. _Epoch-length sensitivity_ (stratified _N_ =150, 50 subjects per class, SVM-RBF probe): 2 s epochs yield 0 _._ 707, 4 s (primary) yield 0 _._ 707, and 8 s yield 0 _._ 695 — a width of 1 _._ 2 pp. _Reference electrode_ : not testable here because CAUEEG EDFs are pre-stored in average reference with no mastoid channels present. Under every tested condition, classical features outperform frozen REVE (0 _._ 568 SVM-RBF, 19-channel) by a minimum of 12 _._ 7 pp. The _∼_ 20 pp gap reported throughout is not a product of favourable pipeline choices. 

**Exploratory remediation analyses.** Classifier, projection, normalization, harmonization, few-shot, and adaptation variants did not yield a submission-grade matched comparison that overturned the clean-montage classical-over-REVE ordering. Detailed results and exclusions are reported in the Supplement; legacy 21-channel caches are not used for inference.

The final rows use the authors’ patient-disjoint held-out annotation as a leakage bound. All primary rows use the clean montage; incompatible legacy caches are excluded from inference.

**Architectural-bias control.** To test whether REVE’s cross-population failure is architectural or representational, we re-initialized REVE with random weights (3 seeds: 42, 43, 44) and extracted embeddings from the same 19-channel CAUEEG pipeline, evaluating on the 3-way Normal/MCI/Dementia task. Random-init REVE achieves 0 _._ 662 AUROC (SVM-RBF+PCA(50) probe, 3-way, single run); across the three random seeds (42/43/44) the grand mean is 0 _._ 659 versus 0 _._ 570 for same-pipeline pretrained REVE (0 _._ 568), a +8 _._ 9 pp grand-mean gap in favor of random initialization. The direction is unanimous: random initialisation exceeds pretrained REVE in all 15 paired evaluations (3 seeds _×_ 5 folds). Because the three seeds re-use the same five fold partitions, the folds, not the 15 seed _×_ fold pairs, are the independent statistical unit; a Wilcoxon test on all 15 pairs ( _p_ =6 _._ 1 _×_ 10<sup>_−_5</sup> ) is anticonservative through pseudoreplication. Treating the five folds as the unit (seeds averaged within fold), the mean gap is +8 _._ 9 pp and every fold favours random initialisation (one-sided Wilcoxon _p_ =0 _._ 031; the two-sided test floors at _p_ =0 _._ 0625 for _n_ =5). The effect is therefore large and directionally unanimous, with formal two-sided significance limited by the five-fold design. Pretrained and random-init embeddings are compared under a matched extraction pipeline and a matched probe, so the gap is not a probeconfiguration or extraction artifact: REVE’s Western pretraining does not add, and numerically removes, Korean-dementia discriminative signal relative to a random encoder. The deficit is representational, not architectural: random initialisation reaches 0 _._ 662 AUROC, so REVE’s architecture can extract Korean EEG signal that the pretrained weights do not surface. _The reversal is representational, not an embedding-geometry artifact._ Pretrained REVE embeddings are in fact _more_ anisotropic than random-init (participation ratio 13 _._ 1 vs. 16 _._ 3; the top-10 eigendirections carry 62% vs. 55% of total variance), so one might suspect the random-init advantage merely reflects a better-conditioned covariance under an RBF kernel. It does not: whitening the embeddings (PCA-50 with per-component variance normalisation) before a purely _linear_ probe _widens_ the gap to +11 _._ 9 pp (random-init 0 _._ 672 vs. pretrained 0 _._ 554), and per-dimension standardisation widens it further to +12 _._ 6 pp, both larger than the PCA-50 + SVM-RBF gap (+10 _._ 0 pp) under matched probes. Removing the anisotropy strengthens rather than erases the reversal, indicating less probe-accessible Korean-dementia signal under the evaluated pipeline, independent of covariance conditioning. 

**Dataset identity is readily decodable.** We trained the same family of linear probe used for the disease tasks to distinguish ds004504 ( _n_ =88) from CAUEEG ( _n_ =1 _,_ 187) using REVE 

16 

embeddings. Held-out AUROC is 1 _._ 000 both in the full space and after in-fold PCA to 50 components; the identical PCA-50 pipeline decodes Korean 3-way diagnosis at 0 _._ 528. The same PCA-50 probe also separates every tested pair among ds004504, TDBRAIN [40], and ds003490 [41] at AUROC 1 _._ 000. A pre-specified band-limited replication (0.5–40 Hz with perepoch z-scoring) retains AUROC 0 _._ 9998 for ds004504 versus CAUEEG. These results show that dataset identity is prominent in the leading variance directions, but they do not identify its source: site, device, preprocessing history, population, task, and clinical composition differ across datasets.

Figure 5: Frozen REVE 19-channel embeddings pooled across the Western (ds004504, _n_ =88) and Korean (CAUEEG) cohorts, projected with UMAP on the top-50 principal components. For display the Korean cohort is subsampled to _n_ =88, stratified by diagnosis, so that the two cohorts contribute equally; at the full 1 _,_ 187 the Western cohort collapses to a single dense point whose apparent tightness is a sample-size artifact. The two-dimensional coordinates are orthogonally rotated for a compact horizontal layout; the transformation preserves pairwise distances. All reported probe AUROCs use the complete cohorts. (a) In the full map, coloured by acquisition site, the cohorts form two cleanly separated clusters, consistent with the linear site probe (AUROC = 1 _._ 000 at PCA-50). (b,c) Magnified views of the same coordinates for the Western and Korean cohorts, respectively, coloured by diagnosis (healthy control vs. patient; patients pool MCI/dementia for CAUEEG and AD/FTD for ds004504), show healthy and patient subjects intermixed within each cluster. Acquisition site, not disease, therefore organises the representation, consistent with the near-chance Korean 3-way disease decode (0 _._ 528 under the same linear probe). 

**Adaptation sensitivity.** Western-source adaptation followed by Korean probe calibration changed cohort separability, but correct-label and scrambled-label adaptations were similar. This establishes that source-label correctness was not responsible under the evaluated recipe; the label-independent mechanism is unresolved. No matched frozen-to-adapted lift is claimed because the available frozen comparators differ in montage, cache, cohort, or probe configuration. Detailed adaptation results are moved to the Supplementary Material. 

17 

### **4.7 Secondary analyses** 

Detailed adaptation, cross-task, enhanced-classical, nonlinear, and dimensionality-reduction analyses are reported in the Supplementary Material. These experiments are treated as descriptive sensitivities rather than universal scaling rules. In particular, the Gaussian-random-projection comparison operates on pretrained embeddings and tests the choice of linear projection, not pretrained versus random representations. Ambiguous CAUEEG lift comparisons and the retired CHB-MIT token-flattened cache are excluded from inference. 

### **4.8 Statistical Analysis** 

Uncertainty is reported at the subject or fold level used by each evaluation. Repeated seeds are not treated as additional independent folds. For Alzheimer’s disease, the reported interval is an approximate mean-plus-or-minus-two-standard-errors interval rather than a bootstrap interval, and inference is based on paired differences or subject-level aggregation rather than comparing one model’s interval bound with another model’s mean. 

For CHB-MIT, the paired fold statistics and label-permutation result are descriptive: LOSO test subjects are distinct, but fitted models share most of their training data, and no family-wise correction is applied across the exploratory model and task comparisons. AUC-PR and Brier score are reported only for the current full-cohort REVE protocol; calibration values from the retired legacy task are not compared. 

## **5 Discussion** 

### **5.1 Interpretation** 

The results do not support a single causal account based on model scale, channel count, or adaptation data volume: architecture, objective, corpus exposure, task, montage, and evaluation protocol vary together. The Korean result is therefore framed as one external-cohort stress test, not a replicated global population effect. The dataset-pair probes establish readily decodable dataset membership but cannot separate recording site from device, preprocessing, population, or clinical composition. The targeted controls answer different questions and are applied only where their assumptions hold. 

### **5.2 Limitations** 

1. The benchmark is heterogeneous: tasks, cohorts, montages, corpus exposure, and split structures differ, so cross-task patterns are descriptive rather than causal scale or channeldensity effects. 

2. CAUEEG primary cross-validation is recording-level because public patient identifiers are unavailable. The patient-disjoint held-out split is reported as a sensitivity bound, but repeat recordings within training remain unquantified. 

3. The dataset-identity probes confound site with hardware, preprocessing, population, diagnosis composition, and dataset history. They establish decodable dataset membership only. 

4. CHB-MIT uses bipolar derivations with approximate positional coordinates, and per-epoch normalization removes absolute amplitude. An amplitude-aware classical comparator and bipolar-coordinate sensitivity remain to be evaluated. 

5. BENDR and LaBraM have model-specific sampling, bandwidth, channel-padding, and position-mapping mismatches; their frozen results should not be interpreted as clean tests of pretraining objective. 

18 

6. Statistical comparisons are limited by small numbers of independent subjects or folds, overlapping cross-validation training sets, and multiple exploratory analyses. Effect estimates and targeted controls are emphasized over confirmatory significance. 

### **5.3 Implications for Clinical EEG AI** 

The results support an evaluation workflow rather than a deployment claim. For any proposed clinical gain, the evaluation unit should match the intended clinical decision; subject leakage and pretraining exposure should be audited; classical and nonlinear comparators should be strengthened; and controls should be selected for the specific alternative explanation. The CHB-MIT result supports cross-subject ictal-versus-interictal separability for REVE under the tested protocol, but does not establish sample-precise onset detection or broad clinical transfer. TUAB is in-domain, Alzheimer performance is not superior after subject aggregation, and the Korean cohort is a single external stress test. 

## **6 Conclusion** 

We benchmark six EEG foundation models across five clinical tasks, including one external Korean cohort and additional datasets used for dataset-identity probes. Targeted controls were applied to selected REVE findings. Three conclusions are supported: 

- **Dataset shift requires cautious interpretation.** Frozen REVE trails classical features on the Korean dementia evaluation, including on the patient-disjoint sensitivity split. Dataset membership is highly decodable across the tested pairs, but this design cannot isolate recording site from the other differences between datasets. 

- **Controls answer distinct questions.** Random initialization tests pretrained weights, label permutation tests probe capacity, scrambled-label adaptation tests label dependence, and PCA-versus-GRP tests the projection method. On Alzheimer’s disease, the epochlevel point advantage disappears with subject aggregation and stronger comparators; GRP-versus-PCA does not test pretraining. 

- **The clearest controlled positive is narrow.** REVE separates ictal from same-session interictal epochs in held-out CHB-MIT patients and outperforms the matched randominitialized encoder and raw-random-feature control. This does not establish sample-precise onset detection, broad clinical transfer, or superiority of every foundation model. 

The practical implication is methodological: clinical EEG benchmarks should match the evaluation unit to the clinical target, disclose pretraining exposure and preprocessing exceptions, use subject-disjoint splits where identifiers permit, and choose controls according to the claim being tested.
