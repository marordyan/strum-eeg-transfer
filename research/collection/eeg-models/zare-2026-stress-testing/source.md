Abstract
Objective. Pretrained EEG foundation models are increasingly proposed for clinical
decoding, yet whether their reported gains transfer across populations or survive standard
negative controls is unclear.
Approach. We benchmark six models (LaBraM, EEGMamba, CBraMod, REVE, BENDR,
and BIOT) on five clinical tasks across four benchmark datasets using frozen linear probing
with leave-one-subject-out, subject-grouped, or explicitly identified recording-level splits.
Targeted controls are applied to selected REVE findings: random initialisation, random
features, label permutation, scrambled-label fine-tuning, and projection-method sensitivity.
Main results. On Korean dementia (CAUEEG 3-way, recording-level), frozen REVE
reaches 0.568 AUROC against 0.769 for classical features; the ordering holds on the cohort’s
patient-disjoint held-out split (0.565 vs. 0.768). A linear probe distinguishes each tested pair
of datasets from frozen REVE embeddings at or near ceiling (AUROC 1.000 at PCA-50;
0.9998 after restricting the input to 0.5–40Hz and per-epoch z-scoring), whereas the same
PCA-50 pipeline decodes Korean 3-way diagnosis at 0.528. These results show that dataset
identity is prominent in the leading variance directions, without isolating recording site from
hardware, preprocessing, population, or clinical composition. A randomly-initialised encoder
also outperforms pretrained REVE on Korean dementia (0.659 vs. 0.570). On Alzheimer’s
disease, Gaussian random projection and PCA of the same pretrained embeddings perform
similarly (GRP-200 0.875 vs. PCA-200 0.860), showing sensitivity to the projection method
but not testing pretraining itself; at the subject level, classical features nominally exceed
REVE (0.878 vs. 0.867). The clearest controlled positive is cross-subject ictal detection on
CHB-MIT (n=23; REVE 0.793 AUROC, +9.2 pp over a random-initialised encoder), where
positives and negatives share recording sessions.
Significance. The results show that conclusions about EEG foundation-model gains depend
strongly on evaluation unit, dataset shift, comparator strength, and targeted controls. We

1 Introduction
Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most accessible, temporally resolved, and cost-effective
modality for measuring brain activity in clinical settings. Despite these advantages, EEG-based
biomarkers remain underutilized in clinical trials for central nervous system (CNS) disorders,
where Phase II/III failure rates exceed 85% and the average cost per approved drug is $2.6
billion [1, 2]. A primary barrier is the difficulty of extracting generalizable features from EEG
recordings that transfer across patients, recording setups, and clinical conditions [3].

Foundation models, large neural networks pretrained on massive unlabeled corpora via self-
supervised learning, have transformed natural language processing [4] and computer vision [5]
by learning transferable representations that generalize across downstream tasks with minimal
labeled data. In 2024–2025, this paradigm reached EEG, with several groups releasing pretrained
EEG foundation models capable of cross-subject transfer on brain–computer interface (BCI)
and clinical tasks [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
However, the field currently lacks systematic comparisons of these models under standardized
evaluation protocols. Published benchmarks typically evaluate models on datasets from the same
distribution as pretraining data, use varying evaluation protocols (fine-tuning vs. linear probing,
within-subject vs. cross-subject), and rarely test on multiple clinical tasks simultaneously. A
critical gap remains: while foundation models show strong frozen-probe performance on held-out
subjects within diagnosis families (seizure detection, Alzheimer’s screening), it is unclear whether
this transfer generalizes to clinically heterogeneous populations where recording practices, patient
demographics, or disease etiology differ from the evaluation datasets. For pharmaceutical
applications, this domain generalization question is essential: outcome-labeled clinical trial data
often comes from distinct sites with different recording protocols and patient populations than
the benchmark datasets. The AdaBrain-Bench [10] standardizes within- and cross-subject BCI
and clinical evaluation, but with full fine-tuning as its primary strategy, a different set of four
models, no non-Western cohort, and no negative controls; cross-population domain generalization
and control-based validation therefore remain largely untested.
1.1 Contributions
This work asks whether EEG foundation-model gains on clinical tasks survive a change of
population and targeted negative controls. The results are mixed: frozen REVE performs
poorly on the Korean CAUEEG dementia task, dataset identity is readily decodable from its
embeddings, and the interpretation of several within-benchmark gains changes under stronger
comparators or controls. Our contributions are:
1. Cross-population stress test on Korean dementia. On CAUEEG 3-way dementia
classification (recording-level; the cohort ships no patient identifier), frozen REVE lags
classical features by ∼20 pp (0.568 vs. 0.769; the binary HC-vs-Dementia frozen probe is
0.589). The ordering holds on the authors’ patient-disjoint held-out split (0.565 vs. 0.768),
although the recording-level cross-validation gaps remain upper bounds because repeated
patients cannot be grouped.
2. Dataset identity is prominent in frozen embeddings. A linear probe separates
ds004504 from CAUEEG frozen REVE embeddings at AUROC 1.000, including after
projection to the top 50 principal components, whereas the same PCA-50 pipeline decodes
Korean 3-way diagnosis at 0.528. All tested within-Western dataset pairs also separate at
ceiling. A band-limited replication (0.5–40Hz, per-epoch z-scored) remains at AUROC
0.9998. These probes establish readily accessible dataset identity, but do not isolate
recording site from device, preprocessing, population, or diagnosis composition.
3. Targeted controls and stronger comparators. Random initialisation tests pretrained
weights against architecture; label permutation tests probe capacity; scrambled-label
fine-tuning tests whether label correctness contributes to adaptation; and PCA-versus-
GRP compares dimensionality-reduction choices on the same pretrained embeddings.
On Alzheimer’s detection, subject-level aggregation and stronger classical comparators
remove the nominal epoch-level mean advantage. The GRP result is reported only as
projection-method sensitivity, because both PCA and GRP operate on pretrained REVE
features.
4. A controlled positive on ictal detection. On CHB-MIT cross-subject ictal detection
(held-out epilepsy patients, full n=23 cohort), pretrained REVE reaches 0.793 AUROC
2

versus 0.701 for a random-initialised encoder and 0.505 for random features of the raw
signal; the label-permutation probe yields 0.500. Negatives drawn from the same seizure-
containing recordings reduce session-level confounding, and the result is stable to a ±30s
guard band (0.798) and separate seizure-free-recording negatives (0.787).
5. Six-model benchmark. We evaluate LaBraM [6], EEGMamba [7], CBraMod [8],
REVE [9], BENDR [12], and BIOT [13] under a harmonized core pipeline with doc-
umented cohort/model exceptions, subject-disjoint splitting where identifiers are available,
and frozen probing.
6. Secondary findings. No foundation model outperforms classical features in the specific
2-channel binary Sleep-EDF experiment; AD-vs-FTD remains difficult under the evaluated
frozen probes; and stronger classical/nonlinear comparators narrow the CHB-MIT margin
while eliminating the nominal epoch-level AD advantage.
2 Related Work
2.1 EEG Foundation Models
Self-supervised pretraining for EEG was introduced by BENDR [12], adapting wav2vec 2.0 with
contrastive learning. BIOT [13] extended this to multi-biosignal pretraining across EEG, ECG,
and EMG.
LaBraM [6] (ICLR 2024 Spotlight) introduced vector-quantized spectral tokenization with
masked prediction, achieving strong transfer on emotion recognition and motor imagery.
CBraMod [8] (ICLR 2025) proposed criss-cross attention to separately model spatial and
temporal dependencies, outperforming LaBraM on AdaBrain-Bench. EEGMamba [7] (Neural
Networks, 2025)demonstratedthatMamba-basedstate-spacemodels[15,16]achievecompetitive
performancetotransformersatlowerparametercounts. REVE[9](NeurIPS2025)introduced4D
positional encoding for native generalization across arbitrary electrode configurations, pretrained
on 60,000 hours from 92 datasets and 25,000 subjects.
2.2 Evaluation Protocols
Cross-subject evaluation in EEG is challenging due to high inter-subject variability in spectral
characteristics, spatial topographies, and recording conditions [3]. Leave-One-Subject-Out
(LOSO) cross-validation is the strictest protocol, ensuring the model has never seen any data
from the test subject during training. Most published foundation model benchmarks use within-
dataset evaluation, potentially inflating performance when pretraining and evaluation datasets
share distributions (e.g., both from the TUH corpus). The AdaBrain-Bench [10] established a
standardized benchmark that does include clinical tasks (TUAB normal/abnormal, Siena seizure,
and sleep staging) with cross-subject results for each. Its scope differs from ours in five respects:
it evaluates four models (BIOT, EEGPT, LaBraM, CBraMod), not REVE, LEAD, BENDR,
or EEGMamba; it uses full fine-tuning as the primary adaptation strategy; its clinical tasks
are anomaly and seizure detection rather than neurodegenerative or psychiatric diagnosis; it
tests no non-Western cohort; and it runs no negative controls. Two of its findings corroborate
ours: on clinical-monitoring tasks foundation models performed comparably to or worse than
traditional models (on Sleep-EDF the best foundation model reached 69.47% vs. 69.55% for the
besttraditionalmodel, consistentwithour2-channelsleepresult), andlinearprobingconsistently
underperformed fine-tuning, leading its authors to conclude that current foundation models are
not ready for direct generalization from frozen representations.
Benchmarks and critical evaluations of EEG foundation models. A rapidly growing
literature benchmarks EEG-FMs and questions whether their reported gains are robust. Reviews
reportthatlinearprobingisofteninsufficientandthatsupervisedbaselinesremaincompetitive[17,
18]. Controlled and multi-dataset benchmarks similarly report mixed results across tasks and

Linear probing, training only a linear classifier on frozen pretrained features, is the standard
evaluation protocol for foundation models in computer vision [14, 5] and NLP. It measures the

this protocol has been used in AdaBrain-Bench [10] but is not universally adopted. We use it as

3.1 Foundation Models
Seven pretrained EEG foundation models spanning five architectural families were evaluated
across all applicable datasets under a unified frozen linear probe protocol:

†BIOT pretrained on TUH, SHHS, CHB-MIT, and three additional biosignal datasets (EEG, ECG, EMG).
CHB-MIT and TUH TUAB are in-domain for BIOT.
LaBraM [6] (vector-quantized spectral tokeniser with a masked-token transformer) was loaded
via braindecode [26]; its 128-channel position embeddings are linearly interpolated to each
dataset’s channel count, following the standard Vision Transformer approach [27].
EEGMamba [7] uses bidirectional Mamba2 state-space blocks [16]. Disambiguation: we
use the pretrained model of Wang et al. (Neural Networks 192:107816; masked reconstruction;
HuggingFace weighting666/EEGMamba), not the end-to-end multi-task classifier of Gui et al.
(arXiv:2407.20254). We reimplemented its CUDA-only selective scan in pure PyTorch (all 117
pretrained parameters loaded), enabling CPU/MPS execution on Apple Silicon without NVIDIA
hardware.
CBraMod [8] uses criss-cross attention (separate spatial and temporal attention), pretrained by
masked reconstruction on 9,000+ cleaned hours of the TUH EEG corpus. Its public checkpoint
has 4.9M backbone parameters (8.1M with task heads); Table 1 reports the backbone count.
REVE [9] uses 4D positional encoding (3D electrode coordinates plus temporal position) to
handle different electrode layouts without interpolation. REVE-Base (69.4M parameters, 512-d,
22 layers) was loaded via gated HuggingFace access. Because it processes each (channel, time-
patch) pair without spatial pooling, embedding dimension scales with channel count. Models
are evaluated at native dimensionality except where noted; the Supplement compares PCA
and Gaussian random projection as alternative dimensionality-reduction methods on the same
pretrained embeddings.
LEAD exclusion. LEAD [11] was not retained in the comparative tables because the released
model family includes contrastive pretraining and unified supervised fine-tuning configurations,
with ds004504 used in the downstream training collection. The exact exposure of the locally
evaluated checkpoint could not be established sufficiently for a submission-grade held-out
comparison.
BENDR [12] (157M parameters) adapts wav2vec 2.0 contrastive coding to EEG; its Conv1d
encoder (pretrained on 20 channels at 256Hz, with 96× temporal downsampling) requires
21-channel inputs to be truncated and 19-channel inputs zero-padded with a dead channel.
We caution that BENDR’s near-chance frozen-probe results are confounded with a bandwidth
and channel-count mismatch: the wrapper resamples our 200Hz epochs back to BENDR’s
native 256Hz before inference, so the encoder runs at its pretraining rate, but the signal was
decimated to 200Hz and band-limited to 0.5–70Hz upstream and therefore carries no content
above 70Hz; 18-channel bipolar inputs are additionally zero-padded with two dead channels (run
at 200Hz with truncation/padding vs. its 256Hz/20-channel pretraining), so the attribution to
its contrastive, fine-tuning-oriented objective is suggestive; a clean test would run BENDR at
256Hz.

on six EEG/ECG/EMG corpora including CHB-MIT and TUH; inputs are truncated to the first
18 channels. Because its pretraining includes CHB-MIT and TUH, its results on those datasets
are in-domain, and ds004504 Alzheimer’s is its only fully out-of-domain evaluation here.
EEGMamba channel constraint. EEGMamba’s patch embeddings use fixed channel-count-
specific weight shapes that cannot be adapted without retraining; it is therefore evaluated only
on the 21-channel (TUAB) and 2-channel (Sleep-EDF) tasks and excluded from the 19-channel

CHB-MIT [28]: Continuous scalp EEG from the full cohort of 23 pediatric epilepsy patients at
BostonChildren’sHospital(all24CHB-MITcasefiles;casechb21ismergedintothechb01patient
itre-records,andchb12isretained). Standard18-channeldouble-bananabipolarmontage,200Hz,
60Hz notch. Task: cross-subject ictal detection. Positive epochs overlap an annotated
seizure by ≥50%; negatives are interictal segments drawn from the same seizure-containing
recordings, at a 1:3 ictal:interictal ratio (per subject). All seizure-containing recordings per
subject are included (acquired by HTTP byte-range fetch of the ictal windows plus a spread grid
of interictal windows, given the ∼40KB/s PhysioNet link). Because positives and negatives share
the recording session, recording-session confounding is designed out, confirmed by ±30s guard-
band and all-files sensitivity analyses (Section 4.1). Verified absent from REVE’s pretraining
corpus (the only PhysioNet sources were Siena and ICARE [9]); this is a genuine out-of-domain
evaluation.
CHB-MIT methods notes. (i) No amplitude-based rejection: the Methods’ >500µV peak-to-
peak rejection is disabled for CHB-MIT because ictal epochs are legitimately high-amplitude
and would be selectively discarded (it removed 27 of 28 ictal epochs of a 113s seizure in testing);
the per-class rejection rate is therefore 0% for both classes and the 1:3 ictal:interictal ratio is
exact. (ii) Amplitude normalisation: per-epoch z-scoring (step 7, a pretraining-compatibility
constraint since the foundation models expect normalised inputs) removes absolute amplitude,
the single most discriminative property of an ictal epoch, from both the encoder inputs and the
relative-band-power classical features. This handicaps the classical comparator on ictal detection
and, if anything, makes REVE’s margin conservative; an amplitude-aware classical baseline
would be a stronger comparator and is not evaluated here. (iii) Bipolar coordinates: REVE
is run with the first 18 positions of its standard 10–20 coordinate bank (the generic-position
convention used throughout), because CHB-MIT’s bipolar derivations (e.g. FP1-F7) have no
6

single 3D electrode coordinate; the 4D positional encoding is therefore approximate on this
montage, and a bipolar-aware assignment (first-electrode vs. midpoint) is untested, a caveat that
applies to the one task where REVE wins.
Label note: All CHB-MIT subjects are epilepsy patients (pediatric intractable-epilepsy
cases recorded during pre-surgical evaluation with anticonvulsant withdrawal); the dataset
contains no non-epileptic controls. Positive epochs are ictal: they overlap an annotated seizure
interval by ≥50%; negative epochs are interictal segments from the same seizure-containing
recordings. Thetaskisthereforecross-subject ictal detection(ictalvs.same-sessioninterictal
epochs, in held-out epilepsy patients), not detection of a persistent epileptic-brain trait and not
sample-precise onset localisation from short windows, which is a harder, separately defined task.
TUH Abnormal (TUAB) [29]: Clinical hospital EEG from Temple University Hospital,
evaluation set. 253 subjects, 21 channels (10–20 system). Binary labels: normal vs. abnormal,
annotated by board-certified neurologists. This dataset shares clinical population and recording
protocol with the TUEG corpus used for CBraMod and LaBraM pretraining. Cross-referencing
against the published pretraining dataset list [9], TUH is confirmed as the largest source
in REVE’s pretraining corpus (14,987 subjects, 26,847 hours, 44% of all pretraining data).
The REVE authors removed downstream evaluation data from pretraining, but distributional
similarity remains. Consequently, all six foundation models evaluated here should be considered
in-domain for this evaluation, and TUAB results should not be compared directly with out-of-
domain results (CHB-MIT, Alzheimer’s).
OpenNeuro ds004504 [30]: Eyes-closed resting-state EEG recorded with 19 channels in the
standard 10–20 montage. The dataset comprises 36 Alzheimer’s disease, 23 frontotemporal
dementia (FTD), and 29 healthy control subjects; the binary AD-vs-HC task uses n=65 (36 AD
+ 29 HC), the 3-way AD/FTD/HC task uses n=88, and the AD-vs-FTD task uses n=59 (36 AD
+ 23 FTD). Recordings were ICA-preprocessed. Binary classification: Alzheimer’s disease vs.
healthy control. Evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation with zero subject overlap
between folds. Verified absent from REVE’s pretraining corpus (cross-referenced against all 56
OpenNeuro datasets in [9]); this is a genuine out-of-domain evaluation. REVE’s pretraining on
diverse clinical populations enables generalization to unseen cohorts, the intended benefit of
foundation model pretraining, not data leakage.
Sleep-EDF [31]: Whole-night polysomnographic recordings from 20 healthy subjects (14
retained after excluding subjects with fewer than 5 epochs of both wake and sleep classes). 2
EEG channels (Fpz-Cz, Pz-Oz). Original 30s annotations (W, N1, N2, N3, REM) binarized to
Wake vs. Sleep, then re-epoched into 4s windows with majority-vote labeling.
CAUEEG (Chung-Ang University Hospital EEG) [32]: Clinical EEG database from
Chung-Ang University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea. The release provides recording-level
dementia labels but no public patient identifier for grouped cross-validation. We therefore
report recording-level cross-validation explicitly and use the authors’ patient-disjoint held-out
annotation as a sensitivity bound. The cohort differs from the benchmark datasets in site,
hardware, population, clinical composition, and dataset history, so no single source of shift is
isolated.

high-amplitude; BENDR is resampled back to 256Hz after the shared band limit and uses
channel truncation or padding; EEGMamba is run at 200Hz. These departures from each

model’s pretraining pipeline are treated as limitations rather than evidence about architectural
objectives.
3.4 Classical Baseline
To quantify the marginal value of foundation model representations, we compare against hand-
craftedfeatures: relativebandpowerinδ (0.5–4Hz),θ (4–8Hz),α(8–13Hz),β (13–30Hz),γ (30–
45Hz) computed via Welch’s method [34]; Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, complexity) [35];
and Shannon spectral entropy. Total: 9×N +2 features per epoch (spectral/temporal features
ch
plus hemispheric alpha asymmetry and frontal theta power).1 Classifier: L2-regularized logistic
regression with balanced class weights.
Enhanced classical and nonlinear comparators add connectivity, entropy, detrended-
fluctuation, wavelet, aperiodic, and nonlinear-classifier sensitivities. They are described in
the Supplement and are used to test whether conclusions depend on an intentionally simple
spectral comparator. The aperiodic exponent is treated as a putative physiological proxy rather
than a direct measure of excitation–inhibition balance.
3.5 Evaluation Protocol
Frozen linear probing. Each pretrained encoder is frozen (no gradient updates). A logistic re-
gression classifier with L2 regularization (class weight=‘balanced’, solver=‘lbfgs’, max iter=1000)
is trained on the extracted embeddings. Both regularization strengths were fixed a priori
(specified before any results were examined, not selected per task or tuned to outcomes) rather
than cross-validated: C = 1.0 for the primary LOSO seizure and TUAB tables, and C = 0.1
(the default of the shared cross-validation utility) for the Alzheimer’s and cross-population
analyses. A post-hoc sweep over C ∈ {0.001,0.01,0.1,1.0,10.0,100.0} on REVE/CHB-MIT,
REVE/ds004504, and CBraMod/CHB-MIT bounds the consequence of this choice: the ds004504
probe is optimal at C ≤0.1, gaining 2.4pp over C =1.0, and the CHB-MIT ictal probe is
C-invariant (mean-fold AUROC 0.793 at C ∈ {0.1,1.0,10}). The ds004504 sweep was run on
an earlier preprocessing of that cohort, so it bounds the sensitivity to C rather than supplying
comparable absolute values. No model ranking changes, so no comparative conclusion depends
on the choice; the swept counterpart is reported alongside as a sensitivity value throughout. C is
fixed a priori rather than tuned in a nested inner loop; the sweep above bounds the consequence
of that choice. Class imbalance is handled uniformly via sklearn’s ‘balanced’ class weights (no
undersampling or oversampling).
Cross-subject evaluation. CHB-MIT and Sleep-EDF use Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO)
cross-validation. TUH TUAB (253 subjects) and ds004504 (65 subjects) use 5-fold stratified
group cross-validation with zero subject overlap between folds.
Metrics. Balanced accuracy (BA) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC) are reported as mean ± standard deviation across folds.
Line-noise filtering. Each included cohort is notch-filtered at its own mains frequency:
50Hz for the Greek (ds004504) and Dutch (TDBRAIN) recordings, and 60Hz for the Korean
(CAUEEG) and US (CHB-MIT, TUAB, ds003490) recordings. Line-noise handling measurably
affects results on ds004504, so the filtering state is stated wherever it bears on a comparison. The
AD-vs-HC analyses (Table 5) and the band ablation apply the 50Hz notch. The AD-vs-FTD
analyses (Table 7) and the ROI-pooling ablation predate it and are reported unfiltered; their
absolute values are not directly comparable to the AD-vs-HC ones.

AUROC of 0.920. The correction preregistration committed to reporting that value alongside the
rerun because the earlier pipeline used an incomplete cohort and a different negative-sampling
construction. The present full-cohort, same-session ictal task is the confirmatory analysis; the
earlier value is disclosed only to document the change in task and is not used in any comparison

overlap an annotated seizure by ≥50%; negatives are interictal epochs drawn from the same

REVE is nominally highest and is the model evaluated with random-initialisation, raw-random-feature, and
label-permutation controls; LaBraM’s similar result was not subjected to those controls. BENDR is not

Four pretrained encoders exceed the classical point estimate (Figure 2), although BIOT
has CHB-MIT pretraining exposure and therefore is not an out-of-domain comparison. REVE
and LaBraM are nearly tied; only REVE was subjected to the targeted control analyses below.
BENDR is near chance under this wrapper configuration, but the result is confounded by
implementation mismatches and is not attributed to its pretraining objective. The paired fold
comparison between REVE and classical is treated as descriptive because LOSO training sets
overlap and the benchmark contains multiple model and task comparisons.

Figure 2: CHB-MIT cross-subject ictal detection on the full cohort. BIOT has CHB-MIT
pretraining exposure; among models without known exposure REVE and LaBraM are nearly
tied. Targeted controls were applied to REVE, not to every model. Error bars are fold standard
deviations; the dashed line marks the classical baseline.
Interpretation note: cross-subject ictal detection with same-session negatives. Pos-
itive epochs overlap an annotated seizure by ≥50%; negative epochs are interictal segments
drawn from the same seizure-containing recordings, so the task is within-session ictal-vs-interictal
discrimination generalised across held-out patients. Because positives and negatives share acqui-
sition session, electrode state, medication level, and time of day, recording-session confounding
is designed out rather than merely acknowledged: the result is unchanged by a ±30s peri-ictal
guardband(0.798)andbarelymoveswhennegativesareinsteaddrawnfromseparateseizure-free
recordings (0.787; sensitivity analyses in this section). The discriminative signal is therefore a
genuine ictal spectral–temporal state (low-frequency rhythmic build-up and post-ictal slowing)
that generalises across patients, rather than a stable trait of the epileptic brain or a session-level
artifact. The 0.793 AUROC quantifies cross-subject ictal detection; it does not license claims
about sample-precise onset localisation from short windows, nor treatment-response prediction,
which are harder, causal tasks this benchmark does not test.
Targeted controls for the ictal result. A matched random-initialized REVE tests pretrained
weights against architecture; a raw-signal random-feature map tests a simple nonlearned repre-
sentation; and within-subject label permutation tests probe capacity. Pretrained REVE exceeds
both feature controls and the permuted-label probe returns to chance. Sensitivities using a
peri-ictal guard band and negatives from separate seizure-free recordings give similar point
estimates. These checks support a narrow cross-subject ictal-versus-interictal result for REVE;
they were not applied to every encoder and do not establish sample-precise onset detection.

At the epoch level, several encoders have similar point estimates. This ordering is not clinically
primary: after aggregating predictions to subjects, classical features are nominally ahead of
REVE. Enhanced classical features and a spectral-feature MLP also match or exceed the epoch-
level REVE value (Supplement). LaBraM shows embedding-level non-determinism on MPS, and

Primary subject-level result. Aggregating epoch probabilities to one score per subject,
classical features reach 87.8±7.9% and REVE 86.7±6.8% subject AUROC under 5-fold group
CV. The 1.1pp separation is well inside the fold spread; there is no subject-level mean advantage
for REVE. Subject-level balanced accuracy is 79.0 ± 4.0% for REVE and 78.1 ± 11.6% for
classical; with only five folds, the dispersion difference is descriptive rather than a demonstrated
stability effect.
Frequency-band ablation. To localise which frequencies carry REVE’s AD-relevant variance,
we bandpass-filtered each epoch to a single band, re-normalised within epoch and channel,
re-extracted REVE embeddings from the band-limited signal, and re-ran the 5-fold probe. Sub-
alpha (0.5–13Hz) and low+theta (0.5–8Hz) match or slightly exceed broadband performance
(both84.5%vs.83.6%),whilegammafallsto61.8%,closetochanceand21.8ppbelowbroadband:
REVE’s AD discriminability is concentrated in slow-wave frequencies below 13Hz, consistent
with the known neurophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (Figure 3, Table 6).

(0.5–13Hz) and low+theta (0.5–8Hz) retain the broadband pipeline’s performance, whereas

Interpretation. In this cohort and extraction pipeline, REVE retains AD/HC discriminability
when the input is restricted below 13Hz and loses performance with gamma-only input. This is
a model-behaviour result, not evidence that high-frequency activity is biologically irrelevant or
that the representation contains information beyond conventional spectral features.

These analyses predate the 50Hz notch used for AD-vs-HC and are not directly comparable with that task.
All evaluated models show weak and variable discrimination on AD vs. FTD under the frozen
probes. This result describes performance under the evaluated pipeline; it does not establish
that the recordings contain no discriminative information or identify the biological reason for
the difficulty.
ROI pooling ablation. Extracting REVE token subsets by region gives full 64.7%, frontal
65.0%, posterior 60.0%, frontal+posterior 65.6%, and temporal 61.8% AUROC (Figure 4).
ROI selection does not materially improve performance; whether sample size, label ambiguity,
preprocessing, or representation is limiting cannot be distinguished here.

LaBraMandEEGMambahavesleep-domainpretrainingexposure(SHHSorHMCincorpora;distributional-
adjacent). CBraMod and REVE are OOD on sleep data. The negative result is therefore ambiguous for
distributional-adjacent models: even with relevant pretraining, they fail to outperform classical features at 2
channels.
None of the four foundation models beats classical on 2-channel sleep EEG: Classical 68.6%,
EEGMamba 68.1%, CBraMod 68.3%, REVE 62.3% (−6.3 pp), LaBraM 58.1% (−10.5 pp). The
two largest deficits belong to LaBraM (−10.5 pp, 5.8M) and REVE (−6.3 pp, 69.4M), while the
two models closest to classical are among the smallest (CBraMod −0.3 pp at 4.9M; EEGMamba
−0.5 pp at 3.3M), so the ordering here does not track parameter count. Fold variance is high
for every model including the classical baseline (±11.9 to ±14.1 AUROC), reflecting subject
heterogeneity across a 14-subject leave-one-subject-out evaluation rather than an instability
| specific | to any one model. |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Two factors explain the failure. First, binarising the 5-class annotations
(W/N1/N2/N3/REM) into Wake vs. Sleep discards the stage-specific spectral structure
(spindles, K-complexes, delta synchrony) that foundation-model representations exploit. Second,
the 2-channel differential montage (Fpz-Cz, Pz-Oz) lacks the spatial coverage positional
encodings use; for REVE the compound names were resolved to single electrodes (Fpz,
Pz), which may actively hurt its 4D positional encoding. The conclusion is specific to this
binary/2-channel setup and does not preclude a foundation-model advantage in multi-class
| staging | with ≥19 channels. |     |     |     |     |     |

4.6 Domain Generalization Under Clinical Heterogeneity (CAUEEG, HC vs.
Dementia)
The benchmark results above test REVE on publicly available datasets where pretraining data
is either included in-domain or excluded from the pretraining corpus. A critical question for
pharmaceutical applications is whether REVE’s frozen representations generalize to clinical pop-
ulations that differ substantially from either reference dataset. To assess domain generalization
under realistic heterogeneity, we evaluated REVE on CAUEEG (Chung-Ang University Hospital
EEG) [32], a clinical EEG database from Seoul, South Korea (1,379 recordings from 1,155
patients; 21-channel 10–20 montage, 200Hz). For the HC vs. Dementia binary task, MCI cases
are excluded, yielding 770 per-recording embeddings (459 HC, 311 Dementia; one mean-pooled
embedding per CAUEEG serial). Protocol (recording-level). CAUEEG contains more
recordings than patients (1,379 recordings from 1,155 patients), but the public release carries

age, and symptom labels, and the EDF patient-identification field is anonymised to X X X X in
all 1,379 files. Patient-grouped cross-validation is therefore not constructible on this cohort, and
everyCAUEEGcross-validationfigurereportedhereisarecording-level 5-foldsplitoverper-serial
embeddings. Two tasks are reported. On the 3-way Normal/MCI/Dementia task (N=1,187
recordings) the classical band-power baseline reaches 0.769 AUROC (LDA; 0.765 SVM-RBF,
0.761 LogReg) while frozen REVE reaches 0.568 (SVM-RBF), a ∼20pp classical advantage. On
14

the binary HC-vs-Dementia task (N=770 recordings; 459 HC, 311 Dementia) frozen REVE
reaches 0.589 (SVM-RBF on PCA(50)) while the matched binary classical band-power baseline
reaches 0.894 (SVM-RBF; 0.895 LogReg, 0.897 LDA): a 30.5pp classical advantage wider than
the 3-way gap. A NARPS-style robustness sweep (probe family and 2/4/8s epoch length;
Classical-baseline robustness, below) never lowers the classical advantage below +12.7pp (its
minimum, from the 8s-epoch N=150 sub-analysis: classical 0.695 vs. frozen REVE 0.568).
Same-patient leakage bound. The exposure this protocol leaves is real and quantifiable. The
CAUEEG authors ship a dementia-no-overlap.json variant of their fixed split which, per
the dataset documentation, excludes all patient-overlapping cases with training data from the
validation and test sets; diffing it against dementia.json shows the training split unchanged
and 65 of the 237 held-out recordings removed (27.4%), so on the order of a quarter of a held-out
CAUEEG sample carries a same-patient partner in training. That diff is also the only public
trace of patient identity, and it supports a direct bound: we trained each probe once on the
authors’ fixed training split and scored it, unchanged, on three evaluation sets differing only in
patient overlap, namely the full held-out set, its patient-disjoint subset, and the overlapping
remainder. On the binary task (train = 616) the classical baseline reaches 0.919 AUROC on
the 111 patient-disjoint recordings (LDA, bootstrap 95% CI [0.869,0.962]; 0.917 LogReg, 0.879
SVM-RBF) against 0.935 on the full 154 — so the 0.894 recording-level CV value is not an
artifact of same-patient repetition — while frozen REVE stays near chance (0.633 LogReg,
0.557 SVM-RBF). On the 3-way task (train = 950) the patient-disjoint classical value is 0.768
([0.708,0.822]), matching the 0.769 recording-level CV headline, against frozen REVE 0.565.
The reversal therefore survives the only patient-disjoint evaluation this release permits. Two
caveats temper it. First, same-patient repeats are strongly identifying for spectral features and
not for REVE: on the overlapping recordings alone the classical baseline reaches 0.978–0.991
(binary) and 0.840–0.868 (3-way) whereas frozen REVE does not benefit (0.479–0.543 across
both tasks and probes), so leakage inflates the gap by ≈5pp in both tasks. On this fixed
split the classical-minus-REVE gap falls from 0.337 to 0.286 (binary) and from 0.252 to 0.203
(3-way) once the overlapping recordings are removed; the corresponding cross-validated gaps
(0.305 and 0.197, Table 9) should likewise be read as upper bounds. Second, the authors’
annotation covers only train-versus-held-out overlap; repeat recordings lying entirely inside
the training split are neither annotated nor removable, and the single fixed held-out sets (111
binary, 172 3-way recordings) give wide intervals. Shared-split controls. Real-label and
scrambled-label adaptation use the same recording-level splits, making them paired with respect
to split assignment, but representations may exploit repeated-patient structure differently; the
confound is shared rather than cancelled. The patient-disjoint held-out analysis is therefore the
relevant leakage sensitivity. CAUEEG also differs from the benchmark datasets in demographics,
clinical setting, and diagnostic heterogeneity.
Classical baseline robustness. To guard against the possibility that the classical AUROC
advantage is a pipeline artefact, we conducted a sensitivity analysis across the accessible pipeline
dimensions [39]. Probe sensitivity (full N=1,187, cached features, recording-level 5-fold CV):
classical AUROC spans 0.761 (LogReg) to 0.769 (LDA) to 0.765 (SVM-RBF), a total width of
0.8pp. Epoch-length sensitivity (stratified N=150, 50 subjects per class, SVM-RBF probe): 2s
epochs yield 0.707, 4s (primary) yield 0.707, and 8s yield 0.695 — a width of 1.2pp. Reference
electrode: not testable here because CAUEEG EDFs are pre-stored in average reference with no
mastoid channels present. Under every tested condition, classical features outperform frozen
REVE (0.568 SVM-RBF, 19-channel) by a minimum of 12.7pp. The ∼20pp gap reported
throughout is not a product of favourable pipeline choices.
Exploratory remediation analyses. Classifier, projection, normalization, harmonization,
few-shot, and adaptation variants did not yield a submission-grade matched comparison that
overturned the clean-montage classical-over-REVE ordering. Detailed results and exclusions are
reported in the Supplement; legacy 21-channel caches are not used for inference.

Architectural-bias control. To test whether REVE’s cross-population failure is architectural
or representational, we re-initialized REVE with random weights (3 seeds: 42, 43, 44) and
extracted embeddings from the same 19-channel CAUEEG pipeline, evaluating on the 3-way
Normal/MCI/Dementia task. Random-init REVE achieves 0.662 AUROC (SVM-RBF+PCA(50)
probe, 3-way, single run); across the three random seeds (42/43/44) the grand mean is 0.659
versus 0.570 for same-pipeline pretrained REVE (0.568), a +8.9pp grand-mean gap in favor
of random initialization. The direction is unanimous: random initialisation exceeds pretrained
REVE in all 15 paired evaluations (3 seeds × 5 folds). Because the three seeds re-use the same
five fold partitions, the folds, not the 15 seed×fold pairs, are the independent statistical unit;
a Wilcoxon test on all 15 pairs (p=6.1×10−5) is anticonservative through pseudoreplication.
Treating the five folds as the unit (seeds averaged within fold), the mean gap is +8.9pp and
every fold favours random initialisation (one-sided Wilcoxon p=0.031; the two-sided test floors
at p=0.0625 for n=5). The effect is therefore large and directionally unanimous, with formal
two-sided significance limited by the five-fold design. Pretrained and random-init embeddings are
compared under a matched extraction pipeline and a matched probe, so the gap is not a probe-
configuration or extraction artifact: REVE’s Western pretraining does not add, and numerically
removes, Korean-dementia discriminative signal relative to a random encoder. The deficit is
representational, not architectural: random initialisation reaches 0.662 AUROC, so REVE’s
architecture can extract Korean EEG signal that the pretrained weights do not surface. The
reversal is representational, not an embedding-geometry artifact. Pretrained REVE embeddings
are in fact more anisotropic than random-init (participation ratio 13.1 vs. 16.3; the top-10 eigen-
directions carry 62% vs. 55% of total variance), so one might suspect the random-init advantage
merely reflects a better-conditioned covariance under an RBF kernel. It does not: whitening
the embeddings (PCA-50 with per-component variance normalisation) before a purely linear
probe widens the gap to +11.9pp (random-init 0.672 vs. pretrained 0.554), and per-dimension
standardisation widens it further to +12.6pp, both larger than the PCA-50 + SVM-RBF gap
(+10.0pp) under matched probes. Removing the anisotropy strengthens rather than erases the
reversal, indicating less probe-accessible Korean-dementia signal under the evaluated pipeline,

Dataset identity is readily decodable. We trained the same family of linear probe used
for the disease tasks to distinguish ds004504 (n=88) from CAUEEG (n=1,187) using REVE
16

embeddings. Held-out AUROC is 1.000 both in the full space and after in-fold PCA to 50
components; the identical PCA-50 pipeline decodes Korean 3-way diagnosis at 0.528. The
same PCA-50 probe also separates every tested pair among ds004504, TDBRAIN [40], and
ds003490 [41] at AUROC 1.000. A pre-specified band-limited replication (0.5–40Hz with per-
epoch z-scoring) retains AUROC 0.9998 for ds004504 versus CAUEEG. These results show that
dataset identity is prominent in the leading variance directions, but they do not identify its
source: site, device, preprocessing history, population, task, and clinical composition differ across
datasets.

and Korean (CAUEEG) cohorts, projected with UMAP on the top-50 principal components.
For display the Korean cohort is subsampled to n=88, stratified by diagnosis, so that the two
cohorts contribute equally; at the full 1,187 the Western cohort collapses to a single dense
point whose apparent tightness is a sample-size artifact. The two-dimensional coordinates are
orthogonally rotated for a compact horizontal layout; the transformation preserves pairwise
distances. All reported probe AUROCs use the complete cohorts. (a) In the full map, coloured
by acquisition site, the cohorts form two cleanly separated clusters, consistent with the linear
site probe (AUROC = 1.000 at PCA-50). (b,c) Magnified views of the same coordinates for the
Western and Korean cohorts, respectively, coloured by diagnosis (healthy control vs. patient;
patients pool MCI/dementia for CAUEEG and AD/FTD for ds004504), show healthy and
patient subjects intermixed within each cluster. Acquisition site, not disease, therefore organises
the representation, consistent with the near-chance Korean 3-way disease decode (0.528 under
the same linear probe).
Adaptation sensitivity. Western-source adaptation followed by Korean probe calibration
changed cohort separability, but correct-label and scrambled-label adaptations were similar.
This establishes that source-label correctness was not responsible under the evaluated recipe;
the label-independent mechanism is unresolved. No matched frozen-to-adapted lift is claimed
because the available frozen comparators differ in montage, cache, cohort, or probe configuration.
Detailed adaptation results are moved to the Supplementary Material.

Uncertainty is reported at the subject or fold level used by each evaluation. Repeated seeds are
not treated as additional independent folds. For Alzheimer’s disease, the reported interval is an
approximate mean-plus-or-minus-two-standard-errors interval rather than a bootstrap interval,
and inference is based on paired differences or subject-level aggregation rather than comparing

For CHB-MIT, the paired fold statistics and label-permutation result are descriptive: LOSO

correction is applied across the exploratory model and task comparisons. AUC-PR and Brier

5 Discussion
5.1 Interpretation
The results do not support a single causal account based on model scale, channel count, or
adaptation data volume: architecture, objective, corpus exposure, task, montage, and evaluation
protocol vary together. The Korean result is therefore framed as one external-cohort stress test,
not a replicated global population effect. The dataset-pair probes establish readily decodable
dataset membership but cannot separate recording site from device, preprocessing, population,
or clinical composition. The targeted controls answer different questions and are applied only
| where | their | assumptions | hold. |     |     |     |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
5.2 Limitations
1. The benchmark is heterogeneous: tasks, cohorts, montages, corpus exposure, and split
structures differ, so cross-task patterns are descriptive rather than causal scale or channel-
|     | density | effects. |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
2. CAUEEG primary cross-validation is recording-level because public patient identifiers are
unavailable. The patient-disjoint held-out split is reported as a sensitivity bound, but
|     | repeat | recordings | within training |     | remain | unquantified. |
| --- | ------ | ---------- | --------------- | --- | ------ | ------------- |
3. The dataset-identity probes confound site with hardware, preprocessing, population,
diagnosis composition, and dataset history. They establish decodable dataset membership
only.
4. CHB-MIT uses bipolar derivations with approximate positional coordinates, and per-epoch
normalization removes absolute amplitude. An amplitude-aware classical comparator and
|     | bipolar-coordinate |     | sensitivity | remain | to  | be evaluated. |
| --- | ------------------ | --- | ----------- | ------ | --- | ------------- |
5. BENDR and LaBraM have model-specific sampling, bandwidth, channel-padding, and
position-mapping mismatches; their frozen results should not be interpreted as clean tests
|     | of  | pretraining | objective. |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | ----------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |

6. Statistical comparisons are limited by small numbers of independent subjects or folds,
overlapping cross-validation training sets, and multiple exploratory analyses. Effect
estimates and targeted controls are emphasized over confirmatory significance.
5.3 Implications for Clinical EEG AI
The results support an evaluation workflow rather than a deployment claim. For any proposed
clinical gain, the evaluation unit should match the intended clinical decision; subject leakage
and pretraining exposure should be audited; classical and nonlinear comparators should be
strengthened; and controls should be selected for the specific alternative explanation. The
CHB-MIT result supports cross-subject ictal-versus-interictal separability for REVE under the
tested protocol, but does not establish sample-precise onset detection or broad clinical transfer.
TUAB is in-domain, Alzheimer performance is not superior after subject aggregation, and the
Korean cohort is a single external stress test.
6 Conclusion
We benchmark six EEG foundation models across five clinical tasks, including one external
Korean cohort and additional datasets used for dataset-identity probes. Targeted controls were
applied to selected REVE findings. Three conclusions are supported:
• Dataset shift requires cautious interpretation. Frozen REVE trails classical features
on the Korean dementia evaluation, including on the patient-disjoint sensitivity split.
Dataset membership is highly decodable across the tested pairs, but this design cannot
isolate recording site from the other differences between datasets.
• Controls answer distinct questions. Random initialization tests pretrained weights,
label permutation tests probe capacity, scrambled-label adaptation tests label dependence,
and PCA-versus-GRP tests the projection method. On Alzheimer’s disease, the epoch-
level point advantage disappears with subject aggregation and stronger comparators;
GRP-versus-PCA does not test pretraining.
• The clearest controlled positive is narrow. REVE separates ictal from same-session
interictal epochs in held-out CHB-MIT patients and outperforms the matched random-
initialized encoder and raw-random-feature control. This does not establish sample-precise
onset detection, broad clinical transfer, or superiority of every foundation model.
The practical implication is methodological: clinical EEG benchmarks should match the
evaluation unit to the clinical target, disclose pretraining exposure and preprocessing exceptions,
use subject-disjoint splits where identifiers permit, and choose controls according to the claim
being tested.
