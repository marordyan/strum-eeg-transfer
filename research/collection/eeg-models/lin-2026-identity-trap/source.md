a biological marker from those that reflect subject identity.

1 Introduction
EEG foundation models (FMs) are pretrained on large unlabeled EEG corpora with self-supervised masked-
modeling objectives, and have been proposed as a general substrate for clinical electroencephalography (Jiang
etal.,2024;Wangetal.,2025a;ElOuahidietal.,2025). Ondownstreamtaskswithestablishedwithin-subject
neural contrasts (motor imagery, event-related potentials, sleep staging), reported performance is strong
(Xiong et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025; Kastrati et al., 2025), building on a decade of cross-subject classification
protocols (Lotte et al., 2018). The picture fragments on small-N resting-state EEG (rsEEG), the setting
that matters most for psychiatric and neurodegenerative biomarkers. On cohorts of comparable size and
recording quality, FM performance varies widely across clinical labels (Shen et al., 2026); what controls
this variation has not been addressed at the representation level. Consider the self-reported chronic-stress
dataset of Komarov et al. (2020). A prior FM evaluation on this dataset reports a peak balanced accuracy of
0.9047, using a fixed 80/10/10 train/val/test split in which the same subjects appear in different folds (best
of four data-splitting seeds; the worst seed reaches 0.67) (Wang et al., 2025b). On the same dataset, under
subject-disjoint cross-validation, we observe 0.43–0.50 across three FMs and five classical baselines (Sec. 4.1).
Both numbers can be correct under their own protocols. Neither tells us what the FM has actually learned
about the label.
A single accuracy number cannot resolve this ambiguity. High balanced accuracy under subject-disjoint
cross-validation is consistent with at least three readings: (i) the FM has captured a genuine cross-subject
EEG marker of the clinical label; (ii) the FM has captured stable physiological subject traits that happen
to co-vary with the label in this cohort; or (iii) the FM has captured an entanglement of the two that does
not separate at the read-out. Existing benchmarks enumerate scores (Shen et al., 2026; Xiong et al., 2025;
Wu et al., 2025; Kastrati et al., 2025); protocol critiques identify subject-identity leakage under trial-level
cross-validation as one inflation source (Brookshire et al., 2024). The underlying tension is not EEG-specific.
Resting-state fMRI fingerprinting shows that stable between-individual differences in brain activity are
sufficient to identify subjects (Finn et al., 2015), and that the connections that identify a subject and the
connections that predict behavior occupy different functional systems of the connectome (Mantwill et al.,
2022). Together, these results suggest a recurring competition, across brain-imaging modalities, between
stable subject-identifying structure and the task-related signal that biomarkers depend on. Both lines of
work establish that the problem exists. Neither tells us, for a specific cohort × FM pair, which of the three
readings is operative at the representation level.
We approach this question through one well-characterized physiological component of the EEG spectrum:
the aperiodic 1/f background. The standard FOOOF decomposition separates the EEG power spectrum
into two parts: a broadband 1/fχ component (the aperiodic background itself) and narrow periodic peaks at
canonical bands such as theta and alpha (Donoghue et al., 2020). Periodic peaks carry transient, task-related
state information of the kind clinical biomarkers typically index. The aperiodic background reflects more
stable properties of the recording: cortical excitation–inhibition balance and vigilance state (Gao et al., 2017),
and electrode-level features that vary between individuals and persist across sessions (Kopčanová et al., 2024).
In ordinary EEG analysis, researchers treat the aperiodic background as a per-subject nuisance and remove
it by fitting a parametric model before they analyze the periodic peaks. FMs are pretrained without any
subject-aware objective, so it is unclear whether their representations remove the aperiodic component in the
same way, or instead keep it as an axis that encodes subject identity. This raises a specific, correlational
question: do EEG FM representations on small-N rsEEG co-encode the aperiodic 1/f background with
subject identity along the same representational directions? We can test it on LaBraM and CBraMod; on
REVE the test is inconclusive, because REVE differs from the other two FMs along five design axes at once

Preprint 3
(Sec. 5.5). Independently of this carrier question, fine-tuning shows a cell-conditional pattern: it amplifies
subject-related variance in every cell, but amplifies label-related variance only in cells where the literature
has already established a cross-subject neural marker.
We test this hypothesis on four public small-N clinical rsEEG datasets chosen a priori to populate a 2×2
sampling layout (subject relation of the label × presence of a consensus cross-subject EEG marker) across
three pretrained transformer FMs (LaBraM, CBraMod, REVE). We package the diagnostics required for the
test as FMScope (Fig. 1), a frozen-representation framework with explicit scope conditions per tool. We
make four contributions.
First, an empirical finding we term the Identity Trap: across 12 (cell × FM) frozen pairs the subject-
variance fraction is 13–89× a matched random-Gaussian null; under fine-tuning, subject-variance fraction
rises in all 12 pairs by +10 to +63 percentage points (pp). This dominance is confined to a removable linear
axis: closed-form subject-axis erasure drives a linear subject probe to chance in all 12 pairs, and where the
labelvarieswithinsubject,erasingidentitysignificantlyimproveslabeldecoding(+6to+12ppintheprimary
cells; +4 to +27pp across four external consensus-marker cohorts; one-sided sign test p<10−3).
Second, a representational correlate of the 1/f–subject co-encoding hypothesis: removing the aperiodic
1/f component drops a linear subject probe by 9 to 19 pp uniformly across all four cells on LaBraM and
CBraMod. REVE shows no measurable aperiodic dependence; the LaBraM-and-CBraMod group differs from
REVE along five concurrent design axes (Sec. 5.5), so we report this two-versus-one pattern descriptively
rather than as a mechanism claim.
Third, a cell-conditional outcome map: fine-tuning amplifies label-variance only in cells with a consensus
cross-subject EEG marker (Mann–Whitney U, one-sided p=0.0022, n=12), and the layer-wise label probe
descends monotonically toward chance in the no-consensus trait cell on all three FMs.
Fourth, the FMScope diagnostic framework itself, including its per-tool scope conditions, plus the
clinical/protocol guidelines that follow from the three findings above: recording trait-cell labels as within-
subject contrasts where the state allows, and seeking external physiological validation where it does not;
verifying that within-subject classifier directions agree across subjects before any BCI calibration claim; and
a frozen-feature pre-flight that returns a per-cell verdict (Tab. 4) before any fine-tuning compute is spent.

Figure 1: FMScope overview. Five frozen-representation diagnostics applied to embeddings from a
pretrained transformer EEG-FM. Two of the five establish the Identity Trap: variance decomposition and
subject-axis erasure (LEACE). The other three characterize its origin and structure: aperiodic input ablation,
layer-wise subject/label probe, and within-subject direction consistency. Center: subject identity forms the
dominant axis of the frozen representation and the clinical label a weaker one; the inset shows closed-form
removal of the linear subject components (LEACE). Colors and shapes in the embedding feature space

EEG foundation models. We anchor on three open-weight backbones. LaBraM (Jiang et al., 2024)
feeds raw EEG patches through a temporal CNN into a transformer encoder. The pretraining target is
a discrete vector-quantized code for each patch; a separate decoder maps each code back to the patch’s
Fourier amplitude and phase, so the encoder must learn features that support Fourier reconstruction. It is
pretrained on ∼2,500 hours of mixed EEG. CBraMod (Wang et al., 2025a) uses a criss-cross transformer
that factorizes spatial and temporal attention into two parallel mechanisms. Its patch embedding adds two
branches: a temporal CNN and an FFT-derived energy vector. Pretraining reconstructs raw EEG patches
under an MSE loss. It is pretrained on a cleaned ∼9,000-hour subset of the Temple University EEG Corpus
(TUEG total: ∼15,000 subjects, ∼27,000 hours). REVE (El Ouahidi et al., 2025) is a spatio-temporal
transformer that uses 4D Fourier sinusoidal positional encoding and a linear patch embedding on the raw
signal. PretrainingreconstructstherawEEGunderanL1loss,withanadditionalattention-poolingsecondary
task. It is pretrained on ∼60,000 hours of EEG from 92 datasets covering 25,000 subjects. All three use
masked-modeling self-supervision but differ along at least five design axes (target representation, patch
embedding, reconstruction loss, positional encoding, pretraining corpus diversity), and we therefore report
cross-FM contrasts descriptively rather than as mechanism claims. All three report strong downstream
performance on event-related EEG benchmarks (Xiong et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025), but none has been
characterized at the representation level on small-N clinical resting-state cohorts.
Subject leakage and evaluation protocols. Prior critiques have established that trial-level cross-
validation in clinical EEG inflates accuracy through subject leakage at the train–test boundary (Brookshire

Preprint 5
et al., 2024), and recent benchmarks (Xiong et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025; Kastrati et al., 2025; Shen et al.,
2026) broadly adopt subject-disjoint splitting (with task-specific exceptions, e.g. subject-dependent splits
retained for emotion recognition in EEG-FM-Bench). These works document the inflation; they do not
characterize what the FM has learned in place of the leaked subject signal once subject-disjoint splitting is
enforced. Our starting point is the ambiguity that remains even after subject-disjoint splitting: accuracy
could still reflect subject-correlated features that happen to co-vary with the clinical label in a particular
cohort. We ask, at the representation level, what those features actually are. A concurrent study (Tang et al.,
2026) asks the same of EEG-FMs and also uses LEACE-style erasure as a diagnostic, but applied to a lexicon
of hand-crafted neuro-features (band power, connectivity, entropy). It reports that removing those features
degrades decoding and does not examine the subject-identity axis. We erase the subject axis instead and find
that its removal can improve consensus-marker decoding, the complementary direction.
Prior cross-subject EEG markers for clinical labels. Prior research documents resting-state or
task-related EEG features that have been used as cross-subject biomarkers. For mental arithmetic, a
substantial corpus links frontal-midline theta and parieto-occipital alpha modulation to cognitive task load
(including mental arithmetic) (Klimesch, 1999; Gevins et al., 1997; Klimesch, 2012). For Alzheimer’s and
frontotemporaldementia,anexpert-panelconsensus(Babilonietal.,2021)citesposterioralphapeak-frequency
and power reduction as a candidate clinical biomarker; a recent two-cohort replication (Kopčanová et al.,
2024) reports that the AD-versus-HC spectral signature is “purely oscillatory” and that aperiodic features do
not differ between groups. The aperiodic 1/f slope therefore remains a contested sub-component for AD.
Comparable expert-consensus markers do not exist for our other two labels: frontal alpha asymmetry as
a stress or depression marker remains contested (Reznik and Allen, 2018; van der Vinne et al., 2017), and
the sleep-deprivation dataset paper (Xiang et al., 2024) tabulates individual differences in sleep quality and
traits alongside the rested-versus-deprived recordings without identifying a cross-subject EEG marker. This
asymmetry across the four labels is what motivates our a priori sampling layout (Sec. 3.1). None of these
works ask whether a pretrained FM’s representation has actually learned the marker; that is the question we
take up in Sec. 4.3 via aperiodic ablation of the input.
Aperiodic 1/f background as a subject feature in EEG. The aperiodic 1/f slope and offset are
parametrized by FOOOF (Donoghue et al., 2020). Demuru and Fraschini (2020) demonstrate that these
aperiodic features are stable within an individual across sessions and distinguish subjects independently
of task-evoked oscillations, in parallel to functional-connectivity fingerprinting on fMRI (Finn et al., 2015)
and earlier EEG biometric work (Campisi and La Rocca, 2014; Marcel and Millán, 2007). Demuru and
Fraschini (2020) specifically report that handcrafted aperiodic features identify subjects with higher accuracy
than canonical band-power features, and remain consistent across eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions.
This makes the aperiodic 1/f one identifiable subject-specific carrier in classical EEG features. The fMRI
fingerprinting work cited above documents the same between-subject stability for that modality, without
specifyingwhichspectralcomponentcarriesit. Afollow-onconnectomeanalysisfurtherreportsthattheedges
discriminating individuals show no single-edge overlap with the edges predicting behavior across cognitive,
language, and motor variables, indicating that subject-identifying and label-relevant signals can dissociate at
the network-feature level (Mantwill et al., 2022). To our knowledge, no prior work has asked which spectral
component carries that subject identity inside a pretrained EEG-FM, nor whether it survives self-supervised
pretraining on cross-subject corpora. Sec. 4.3 addresses this question via FOOOF-aperiodic input ablation as
a correlational intervention on the frozen representation.
Mechanism hypotheses for FM representation bias. Three lines of prior ML work motivate, but do
not establish, the mechanisms by which a self-supervised FM might preferentially encode stable physiological
subject features over transient task-related features. Geirhos et al. (2020) document that neural networks
tend to exploit dataset-stable cues that correlate with labels (shortcut features) over invariant discriminative
cues. Under an MSE (squared-error) reconstruction loss, masked-modeling objectives put most of their loss
on the high-variance components of the input, and the model is widely conjectured to spend proportionally

Preprint 6
more capacity on those same components. In EEG, the broadband aperiodic 1/f baseline carries most of the
low-frequency spectral variance by construction. El Ouahidi et al. (2025) explicitly motivate their L1 (rather
than MSE) reconstruction loss as a counter to the L2 sensitivity to noise and outliers in EEG. This is one
concrete design choice on which our three FMs differ. Linear-network analyses (Saxe et al., 2019) additionally
show that gradient descent on a linear network preferentially learns the largest-singular-value directions of
the input–output correlation first, and we conjecture that an analogous direction-ordering operates under
small-N supervised fine-tuning of the FM head. Each of these is a candidate contributing factor for our
findings; we do not isolate any of them experimentally.
Multi-axis taxonomies in EEG-FM benchmarking. ExistingaggregatebenchmarksorganizeEEG-FM
evaluation either as a single-dataset case study or as a leaderboard that aggregates across many tasks and
datasets. EEG-FM-Bench (Xiong et al., 2025), AdaBrain-Bench (Wu et al., 2025), EEG-Bench (Kastrati
et al., 2025), and Brain4FMs (Shen et al., 2026) report dozens of task–dataset cells and broadly converge on
the observation that FMs are not uniformly superior across clinical cross-subject tasks (Aristimunha et al.,
2025): AdaBrain-Bench reports that on clinical monitoring tasks “foundation models perform comparable
or even worse than traditional models” (Wu et al., 2025). An independent review of ten early EEG-FMs
reaches a parallel conclusion at the methodology level: that evaluation strategies across the field remain
heterogeneous and limited, and that standardized, scaled evaluations are a prerequisite for assessing practical
off-the-shelf utility (Kuruppu et al., 2025). Their taxonomies are organized along axes orthogonal to ours
(task category, pretraining objective, or fine-tuning strategy), and none ask which physiological component of
the EEG spectrum the learned representation aligns with. Three FMs and four datasets, selected a priori to
span complementary labeling outcomes, support representation-level diagnostics that read each pair against
the literature-fixed properties the cell carries.
3 Methods
This section covers the sampling layout, feature extraction and evaluation protocol, the fine-tuning recipe,
and the five FMScope diagnostics.
3.1 The 2×2 sampling layout
We assign the four datasets a priori to a 2×2 layout cross-classifying (a) subject relation of the label and
(b) consensus cross-subject marker. Axis A is read from dataset structure: within-subject paired when
each subject contributes recordings under both classes (EEGMAT, SleepDep) versus subject-label trait
when the label is fixed per subject (ADFTD; Stress under per-recording DASS-21 binarization (Lovibond
and Lovibond, 1995)). For Stress, 14 of 17 subjects carry a single label across all their recordings; the 3
mixed-cutoff subjects are kept for the headline benchmark and dropped from any mechanistic diagnostic
that requires a subject-level label. Axis B is a literature-anchored a priori expectation. The consensus
column comprises labels for which prior peer-reviewed EEG work has established a replicable cross-subject
signature: frontal-midline θ and parieto-occipital α modulation for mental arithmetic (EEGMAT; (Klimesch,
1999; Gevins et al., 1997; Klimesch, 2012)), and posterior α peak-frequency reduction for AD/FTD (ADFTD;
(Babiloni et al., 2021) expert-panel consensus). The no-consensus column comprises labels for which no
such signature has been replicated: chronic stress (Stress; frontal alpha asymmetry contested, (Reznik and
Allen, 2018; van der Vinne et al., 2017)) and sleep deprivation (SleepDep; the dataset paper reports no
candidate cross-subject EEG marker, (Xiang et al., 2024)). The 2×2 layout is fixed before any FM is trained,
and we state its falsifiable consequence in advance: fine-tuning should amplify label-variance preferentially in
consensus cells (tested in Sec. 4.4). Tab. 1 summarizes the assignment.
3.2 Per-dataset specifications
All four datasets are small-N (N ≤65) resting-state (or rest-plus-task) EEG at 19–30 channels, 200Hz after
per-dataset resampling. We standardize preprocessing across cells: per-channel mean subtraction, 1–45Hz

et al., 2025). Each backbone receives a 5s by C-channel input at 200Hz and emits a pooled embedding: a
single fixed-length vector summarizing that 5s window, of dimension d∈{200,200,512} depending on the
backbone. Thebackbonedeterminesthepoolingrule,andwedonotre-poolthedata. LaBraMandCBraMod
both produce their embedding by mean pooling over encoder output tokens: LaBraM averages patch tokens
after stripping a prepended classification (CLS) token (matching the release-default head described in Jiang
et al., 2024 §2.1), and CBraMod applies 2D adaptive average pooling over the (channel, patch) grid (one of
the head variants provided in the CBraMod release). REVE returns the attention-pooling secondary-task
token (a learnable query that attends over all channel–patch tokens, per El Ouahidi et al., 2025 §2.4).
Input normalization. All three backbones receive raw microvolt-scale input and each applies its release-
default internal rescaling before its patch embedding. We hold the input contract fixed across cells and do
| not sweep it. |     |     |     |     |
| ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Feature extraction modes. Frozen linear probe (LP) freezes the backbone (no gradient) and passes the
pooled embedding through a percentile-based clip (fit per dimension on each fold’s training data), a standard
scaler, and an L -penalized logistic regression with balanced class weights, all held at fixed canonical values.

Per-window posterior probabilities are mean-pooled within a recording and thresholded at 0.5 to produce the
recording-level decision; the threshold is fixed by design and not tuned. Full fine-tuning (FT) unfreezes the
backbone and adds a single linear classification head trained end-to-end under the recipe in Sec. 3.5. All
three backbones expose the same interface. They take a multi-channel EEG epoch as input and return a
| pooled embedding, | so the training | loop is backbone-agnostic. |     |     |

3.4 Evaluation protocol
Primary protocol: subject-disjoint 5-fold CV. All cells report balanced accuracy (BA), defined as the
unweighted mean of per-class recall, which we use because the cells are class-imbalanced. Cross-validation is
subject-stratified group K-fold with K =5, grouped by subject so that no subject contributes recordings to
both the train and test folds of a given split (Brookshire et al., 2024). We aggregate at the recording level by
averaging per-window posteriors within a recording, thresholding at 0.5, and comparing to the recording
label. This is the single evaluation rule used for the sampling layout axis B classification and the baseline
performance table (Tab. 2).
Multi-seed requirement. Small-N cellsexhibitnon-trivialseed-to-seedFTvariabilityunderdeterministic
cuDNN. We average every balanced accuracy claim over three FT training seeds (seeds {42,123,2024}) and
report it as mean ± sample standard deviation; LP additionally averages over a fixed eight-seed set. Wide
confidence intervals reflect the inherent instability of fine-tuning on small-N cohorts; the relative performance
gaps between tiers remain consistent across seeds.
3.5 Fine-tuning configuration
Each foundation model is fine-tuned under the configuration published in its original repository, applied
uniformly across the four cells; we do not run a per-dataset hyperparameter sweep. All three FMs share
the AdamW optimizer, the cross-entropy loss with label smoothing, early stopping on a moving-average of
held-outbalancedaccuracy,andasinglelinearclassificationheadwithtwooutputunits. LaBraMadditionally
uses the small-scale head initialization prescribed in its release (Jiang et al., 2024).
3.6 Reference baselines (classical and non-FM-deep)
Two reference baselines situate the FM tier in Tab. 2.
Classical handcrafted-feature baseline. A per-recording feature vector is built from the time-averaged
powerspectrum(Welch,n =min(256,T)): foreachchannel,meanband-powerinθ (4–8Hz),α(8–13Hz)
perseg
and β (13–30Hz); per-channel θ/α and θ/β ratios; and frontal/parietal alpha-asymmetry logPright−logPleft
α α
over six electrode pairs (Fp1/Fp2, F3/F4, F7/F8, C3/C4, P3/P4, O1/O2). At 19 channels this yields
5×19+6 = 101 features. We fit L -regularized logistic regression with feature standardization, inverse
2
regularization strength C =1, and balanced class weights, under the same subject-disjoint 5-fold CV, three
seeds.
Non-FM-deep baselines. Four convolutional / hybrid architectures trained from scratch on raw EEG:
EEGNet (Lawhern et al., 2018), ShallowConvNet and DeepConvNet (Schirrmeister et al., 2017), and EEG-
Conformer (Song et al., 2023). Each is trained per dataset under the same CV splits and seeds, with z-score
input normalization (matching the early-BatchNorm convention used in standard implementations of these
architectures). No foundation-model pretrained weights are used.
3.7 Diagnostic method specifications
FMScope comprises five frozen-representation diagnostics, organized by the question each answers. Two
of these establish the Identity Trap itself: whether subject identity dominates the representation (variance
decomposition, Sec. 3.7.1) and whether that dominance is confined to a linearly removable axis (subject-axis
erasure, Sec. 3.7.2). The other three characterize its origin and structure: its spectral carrier (aperiodic
ablation, Sec. 3.7.3), the depth at which it becomes linearly separable (layer-wise probe, Sec. 3.7.4), and
whether subjects encode the task contrast along a shared direction (direction consistency, Sec. 3.7.5). Each
diagnostic carries a scope condition stating the cells in which it returns a defined answer and is read only
where that scope is met, so a cohort need not exercise all five.

Figure 2: FMScope diagnostic pipeline. The framework evaluates frozen representations from EEG
foundation models across three sequential phases. Phase I establishes the existence of the Identity Trap by
quantifying subject-variance dominance and testing its linear removability via least-squares concept erasure
(LEACE). Phase II characterizes the underlying mechanisms using three tools: localizing the depth of
subject-identity emergence (layer-wise probing), isolating the physiological carrier via spectral input ablation
(FOOOF), and evaluating task-axis alignment across subjects (direction consistency). Phase III synthesizes
these diagnostic outputs into an integrated report, converging on a final cell-level verdict for the specific

obtained by subtraction and clipped at zero. We operate at the window level so the partition is defined for
single-session trait cells (ADFTD: each recording yields ≥2 windows). Cluster-bootstrap CIs over subjects
(B =2,000) preserve the within-subject correlation structure (Field and Welsh, 2007). Reading the partition
is cell-conditional. In within-subject paired cells the two factors are orthogonal so the fractions sum to <1;
in trait cells the subject factor structurally contains the label factor, which naturally allows the marginal
fractions to sum to >1 because they represent overlapping variance components. We therefore emphasize the
within-cell label-fraction shift (FT − frozen) rather than absolute fractions. Let f =SS /SS and

Results) rather than as axis-level inference.
3.7.2 Subject-axis erasure
Variance decomposition measures how much of the representation subject identity occupies; erasure tests
whether that identity is confined to a removable linear axis and at what cost to the clinical label. We apply
LEACE (Belrose et al., 2023), least-squares concept erasure: the minimum-displacement affine map that
renders a target concept linearly unpredictable. For per-window embeddings X and one-hot subject labels
Z, LEACE removes the subspace spanned by WΣ , with W=Σ−1/2 the whitening transform, which we

estimate under Ledoit–Wolf shrinkage for numerical conditioning. Centred one-hot labels for k subjects span

removes it by construction and ∆ is undefined. It is read only where the un-erased baseline also clears
erase
chance.
3.7.3 Spectral Anchor Ablation (FOOOF)
We intervene on the EEG via FOOOF ablation, which modifies the spectral shape (aperiodic background vs.
periodic peaks) while preserving frequency support, and observe how the FM’s frozen probe responds.
For each recording we fit a per-channel FOOOF decomposition (Donoghue et al., 2020) on the 1–45Hz
band, parameterizing the log-power spectrum as

where b is an offset, χ (Greek chi) the aperiodic exponent (slope of 1/f on log-log axes; higher χ means
relatively more low-frequency power), and each G (f) a Gaussian peak in log-power. With X(f) the per-

each combined with the original phase spectrum and inverted via FFT. Each reconstruction is re-extracted
through the FM and probed with two diagnostics. The label probe is a binary L -penalized logistic regression
2
on per-window features under subject-stratified group K-fold (K = 5). The pipeline matches the LP
recipe (percentile clip + standard scaler) and aggregates to the recording level by mean-pooling per-window
posteriors; balanced accuracy is averaged over 8 seeds (the LP seed set). The subject-identity probe is a
multi-class classifier of subject identity (one class per subject) under a 5-fold temporal-block protocol: per
subject, the windows are concatenated across recordings in canonical order and split into 5 contiguous blocks;

Preprint
11
fold f tests block f from every subject and trains on the remaining four blocks. The classifier is linear
discriminant analysis with Ledoit–Wolf shrinkage of the within-class covariance toward a scaled identity
matrix. The shrinkage stabilizes the covariance estimate when the number of windows per subject is small.
The classifier uses a closed-form solver with no stochastic optimization, so we run it at a single seed. Per-fold
balanced accuracy is averaged across the 5 folds. On multi-recording cells (EEGMAT, SleepDep, Stress) the
blocks cross recording boundaries, so the probe also tests whether the subject signal is stable across sessions.
ADFTD has only one recording per subject by design, so its blocks are always within a single recording.
FT extension. To extend the intervention from the frozen representation to the fine-tuned representation,
we re-extract and fine-tune each backbone end-to-end on the ablated input under the same recipe as Sec. 3.5
and run both probes (state and subject) on the resulting test-fold per-window features concatenated across
the 5 CV folds. Per (cell, FM, condition) we average ∆probeBA = ablated minus original input over 3
fine-tuning seeds; the FT extension covers both conditions (aperiodic-removed and periodic-removed).
Output. The diagnostic returns a per-cell 1/f-role reading derived from the joint change in label-probe
BA and subject-probe BA under aperiodic removal, where each ∆ is computed as aperiodic-removed minus
original.
Scope condition: all four cells for the label probe and subject probe at frozen and FT representations.

To localize the depth at which subject identity emerges within the encoder, we replay each FM’s forward
pass with eight intermediate-depth captures and apply the same two read-outs used elsewhere in the paper

captured depth. Pooling at each captured depth uses the backbone’s own canonical scheme, so the final-depth

EEGMAT and SleepDep; recording for Stress). We use 999 permutations per (cell, FM, state), giving a floor

4 Results
The Results proceed in four steps. We start with the baseline performance picture: full fine-tuning rarely
improves over a frozen linear probe (Sec. 4.1). To see what fine-tuning starts from, we then characterize the
frozen representation itself; subject identity dominates, and the encoder amplifies it into a linearly separable
direction within its first few transformer blocks (Sec. 4.2). A natural next question is which input feature
carries that subject identity. The aperiodic 1/f background is one such carrier on LaBraM and CBraMod
| (Sec. 4.3). Sec. | 4.4 summarizes | the per-cell | evidence | for the     | final assessment. |     |     |

Fine-tuning rarely beats the frozen linear probe: 10 of 12 pairs fall within ±1pp of the corresponding
LP. ADFTD is the one cell where FM pretraining yields a measurable advantage over the classical and
non-FM-deep baselines. On EEGMAT the classical RF beats every FM tier. On Stress and SleepDep all four
tiers fall within a 0.43–0.57 band. The Wang et al. 0.9047 Stress headline (Wang et al., 2025b) does not

red line marks the matched random-Gaussian null f subj (mean over 20 seeds; per-cell numeric callout in each

subject fraction rises in 12 of 12 pairs (largest on Stress: +32 / +63 / +43pp on LaBraM / CBraMod /
REVE), while label fraction rises only in cells with a consensus cross-subject marker (per-pair values in
| Tab. A1; | null-control | values | in Tab. | A2). |     |     |     |     |     |     |

of 12 (cell × FM) pairs (per-pair values in Tab. A2); fine-tuning increases the subject fraction in all 12
pairs (+10 to +63pp, largest on Stress), while ∆f is positive in 6 of 6 consensus-marker pairs (+0.6 to
label
+8.4pp) and spans zero in 6 of 6 no-consensus pairs (−1.9 to +0.8pp). The two ∆f label ranges do not overlap
(one-sided Mann–Whitney U on the 12 values: p=0.0022, rank-biserial r =+0.94; Sec. 3.7.1).
This subject dominance is a removable linear axis, not diffuse structure (Tab. 3). Closed-form erasure
(Sec. 3.7.2) drives the linear subject probe to chance in all 12 pairs. A nonlinear probe still recovers part of
the identity, substantial for REVE, which we report alongside. Whether removing the axis helps the task can
be asked only in within-subject paired cells, where the label varies within subject. On EEGMAT, the one
such cell with an above-chance baseline, the frozen probes start below the classical baseline (0.847); erasure
lifts all three FMs and closes this gap, with LaBraM reaching 0.875. On SleepDep (no-consensus, near-chance
baseline) the change is small and inconsistent across FMs, as expected when little label signal is present.
This is a single clean demonstration; App. E extends it to five further cohorts with a within-subject contrast,
where ∆ stays positive on all three consensus-marker cohorts and turns mixed-to-negative on the two

A layer-wise re-probe (Sec. 3.7.4; Fig. 4) shows that the subject axis becomes linearly decodable inside the
encoder rather than at the embedding output: the encoder actively amplifies subject identity into a separable

We intervene on the input EEG via FOOOF spectral-shape ablation (aperiodic background versus periodic
peaks; frequency support preserved) and observe the FM probe response (Sec. 3.7.3; Fig. 5).
Removing the aperiodic 1/f component drops the subject probe uniformly on LaBraM and
CBraMod. On LaBraM and CBraMod, FOOOF −aperiodic drops the linear subject probe BA by 9 to
19pp across all four cells (per-(cell, FM) values in Tab. A4; LaBraM: −18.4 / −10.9 / −17.9 / −9.1pp on
EEGMAT / ADFTD / SleepDep / Stress; CBraMod: −18.9 / −10.2 / −17.1 / −9.3pp). The drop is large,
uniform across cells of very different paradigms, and goes in the same direction on both FMs.
REVE’s baseline subject probe is already at ≥ 0.93 BA and shifts by ≤ 1.2pp under −aperiodic; we
therefore limit the aperiodic-anchor claim to LaBraM and CBraMod (Sec. 5.5). FOOOF −periodic shows no
effect across all 12 (cell, FM) pairs (≤0.8pp on both probes). Because both ablations pass through the same
FOOOF decompose-and-invert reconstruction (Eq. 4) and differ only in which component is removed, this
−periodic null rules out the reconstruction round-trip itself as the cause and attributes the −aperiodic drop
to the removed aperiodic content. The label-probe response under −aperiodic is cell-conditional and feeds
| the per-cell | 1/f | role column |     | of Tab. 4. |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------------ | --- | ----------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The same intervention extends to the fine-tuned representation. To test whether FT inherits
the frozen aperiodic dependence, we re-extracted and fine-tuned each FM end-to-end on both ablated inputs
under the same recipe as the baseline run (3 seeds; Sec. 3.7.3) and recomputed both probes on the resulting
features (Fig. 5b, bottom row). On LaBraM and CBraMod, the FT subject probe drops under −aperiodic on
7 of 8 (cell, FM) pairs (mean ∆ ranging from −4 to −20pp, with the per-seed range staying below zero).
LaBraM × ADFTD is the borderline case (−2.0±4.7pp). This is consistent with two properties of that cell:
its frozen subject probe is already near ceiling, and its high recording-level redundancy gives the encoder
multiple non-aperiodic carriers to amplify. −Periodic at the FT level shifts the subject probe by |∆|≤2.5pp
on all 8 (cell, LaBraM/CBraMod) pairs, matching the frozen null and confirming that the FT carrier is the
1/f component, not narrowband peaks. REVE’s FT subject probe shifts by |∆|≤2.5pp on every cell under
| both ablations, |     | preserving | the | negative | control | at the | FT  | representation. |     |     |

Figure4: Layer-wisesubjectandlabelprobes. Rowsshowthesubjectrelationofthelabel(within-subject
paired on top, trait on the bottom); columns show the consensus axis (consensus on the left, no-consensus
on the right). Each panel shows two probes: the temporal-block subject-ID probe (red) and the canonical
recording-level label probe (blue). Lines are the mean across the three FMs (LaBraM, CBraMod, REVE);
shaded bands span their min–max range (n=3 FMs, an envelope rather than a confidence interval). The
horizontal axis is relative transformer depth (0 is post-embedding pre-block; 1 is the final pooled feature).
Across all four cells the subject probe rises toward 0.55–0.99 within two to three transformer blocks; the wide
early-depth band reflects FMs that reach this ceiling at different depths. The label probe is cell-conditional.
Dotted lines mark label chance (0.5) and the per-cell subject-ID chance.

Layer-wise label-probe trajectory (Sec. 3.7.4; Fig. 4). On EEGMAT, the label probe is stable across
depth (0.69–0.78) for all three FMs. On ADFTD, the label probe peaks early (relative depth ∼0.17, BA
0.78–0.83) and descends as later blocks compress along the subject axis without further label gain. On
SleepDep, the label probe is flat near chance (0.50–0.59) at every depth. On Stress, the label probe descends
monotonicallywithdepthonallthreeFMs(LaBraM0.49→0.42;CBraMod0.49→0.36;REVE0.47→0.41):
the modest label-aligned signal in the pre-block embedding does not survive to the final pooled feature.
Within-subject direction consistency (Sec. 3.7.5; Fig. 6). EEGMAT yields group-level mean pairwise
cosine c¯∈[+0.07,+0.15] across three FMs (subjects share a contrast axis above the isotropic null). SleepDep
yields c¯≈ 0 (subjects do not share a contrast axis); cosine PERMANOVA (Sec. 3.7.5; App. C, Tab. A3)
still detects label-associated structure on every (FM, state) pair (p≤0.001). A local per-subject contrast

5 Discussion
TheempiricalcoreofthispaperistheIdentityTrap: acrossfoursmall-N clinicalresting-statecohorts,subject
identity dominates the frozen features of all three EEG-FMs we test, and standard fine-tuning amplifies
this subject geometry in 12 of 12 (cell, FM) pairs while amplifying label geometry only in cells where prior
literature has already established a cross-subject EEG marker. On two of the three FMs, the aperiodic 1/f
background is one identifiable carrier of this subject axis. The four cells map onto four distinct outcomes
(Tab. 4), but they share a single representation bottleneck rather than acting as four unrelated cases.

5.1 The representation bottleneck
FMfeaturescarrystablesubjectgeometrymorestronglythantask-alignedvariance,andfine-tuningreinforces
this ordering rather than correcting it. The frozen-state evidence has three parts. The subject-variance
fraction is 13–89× a matched random-Gaussian null in 12 of 12 frozen pairs (Tab. A2); the layer-wise probe
shows that the subject axis becomes linearly decodable within the first two to three transformer blocks rather
than at the embedding output, so the encoder actively amplifies subject identity into a separable direction;
and closed-form subject-axis erasure confirms this dominance sits on a removable linear axis, collapsing
the linear subject probe to chance in every pair (Tab. 3). On LaBraM and CBraMod, the aperiodic 1/f
background is one identifiable carrier: removing it drops the linear subject probe by 9 to 19pp uniformly
across all four cells. REVE shows no measurable aperiodic dependence; the design-axis differences between
REVE and the LaBraM-plus-CBraMod group are listed in Sec. 5.5.
Fine-tuning then amplifies whatever subject axis it inherits. ∆f is positive in every pair (+10 to
subj
+63pp), whereas ∆f is positive in 6 of 6 consensus-marker pairs (+0.6 to +8.4pp) and spans zero in the 6
label
no-consensus pairs. When no literature-supported cross-subject marker is available for FT to amplify toward,
FT still adapts, but what it adapts toward is the subject axis. This connects to a recurring caution in the
EEG-FM literature. Subject-disjoint critiques (Brookshire et al., 2024) establish that trial-level splits inflate
accuracyviasubjectidentity. Ourdiagnosticaddressesthenextconcern: evenundersubject-disjointsplitting,
subject-correlated features can still survive the split. The bottleneck here is not opaque feature noise; it is the
stable presence of a single identifiable component in the input signal. Prior work identifies subject-disjoint
splitting as a necessary protocol; we show that this protocol alone is not sufficient for clinical discovery if the
model instead aligns its features with stable subject traits. FMScope provides a representation-level account
of this persistent failure.
5.2 Spectral-bias amplification under random-head fine-tuning
Weinterpretthecell-conditionalamplificationasymmetrythroughagradient-geometryreading,nowsupported
on LaBraM and CBraMod by the FT row of Fig. 5b. Fine-tuning concentrates supervised signal along
whichever direction already carries the most variance in the pretrained representation, regardless of whether
that direction aligns with the supervised objective. Across 12 (cell, FM) pairs, ∆f is positive in every case
subj
(+10 to +63pp), and the largest amplifications fall in the no-consensus trait cell where Stress reaches +32 to
+63pp on the three FMs. ∆f is positive in 6 of 6 consensus-marker pairs (+0.6 to +8.4pp) and spans
label

Preprint 19
zero in the 6 no-consensus pairs (−1.9 to +0.8pp). This asymmetry is what we expect if FT acts on existing
axes: subject-axis amplification is universal because that axis is large in every frozen representation, whereas
label-axis amplification depends on whether a label-aligned axis is already large enough to be amplified at
all. Under a randomly initialized classification head, this gradient-geometry reading has formal anchors:
linear probing then fine-tuning analyses show that LP induces a linear-head-norm regime that preserves the
backbone’s pretrained feature directions during the subsequent FT stage (Tomihari and Sato, 2024), and
parameter-efficient adaptation directions that capture the most activation variance provably maximize the
expected gradient signal (Paischer et al., 2024). These results combine with classical linear-network results
showing that gradient descent preferentially learns the largest-singular-value directions of the input–output
correlation (Saxe et al., 2019). The prescription that follows from this combination is layer-localized fine-
tuning keyed to shift type (Lee et al., 2023). Our variance fractions correspond to the marginalization step of
demixed PCA (Kobak et al., 2016), the established systems-neuroscience predecessor of factor-wise variance
accounting.
5.3 A coding pattern shared across modalities
Our finding sits between two adjacent observations, neuroscience-side fingerprinting and ML-side shortcut
learning,whichconvergeonthesameoperationalcompetitionbetweenstablebiometricstructureandunstable
tasksignal. OurdiagnosticdocumentstheIdentityTrap asaspecificdissociation: subjectvariancedominates
thefrozenfeatures,labelvarianceissubordinate,andonLaBraMandCBraModtheaperiodic1/f background
is one identifiable subject carrier. The same dissociation between stable subject structure and task signal is
documented across resting-state fMRI fingerprinting and EEG biometrics (Sec. 2); we show it holds inside
EEG-FM representations as well, using variance decomposition as the test. The broader observation that
deep networks exploit dataset-stable shortcut features over invariant discriminative cues (Geirhos et al., 2020)
supplies the cross-architecture frame. Our diagnostic in turn provides a physically-grounded instance of that
phenomenon in biosignal foundation models: the shortcut here is not a pure statistical artifact of the training
corpus but has a measurable physiological component of the input (the aperiodic 1/f background), high-
energy, cross-session stable, and easier to reconstruct than the clinical signal the model is nominally trained
to support. Concurrent prescriptive work on cross-subject EEG/MEG-FM adaptation includes SuLoRA,
which decomposes each weight matrix into a shared component and a per-subject low-rank correction (Klein
et al., 2025), and SCOPE, a prototype-guided adaptation framework for label-limited EFM fine-tuning (Ma
et al., 2026). Both prescribe a fix (adding subject-specific parameters or prototypes) without measuring the
subject axis they adapt to, and neither relates it to a physiological component of the signal. Our diagnostic
is complementary and upstream: it quantifies the axis in the frozen feature space, shows it is removable in
closedform,andidentifiesonephysiologicalcarrier. Bothadaptationmethodsareevaluatedonwithin-subject
task contrasts or consensus-marker datasets; whether they extend to the no-consensus column, which we
predict to be intractable, remains open.
5.4 Implications and FMScope use
We draw three deployment-side implications from the assessment matrix. The pre-pilot frozen-feature pass
is a cheap filter: when the assessment falls below linear-probe resolution (Stress on all three FMs), the
bottleneck lies in the recording substrate itself (an information deficit) rather than in model capacity. Scaling
the pretraining corpus or model size does not address this class of failure; the remedy lies in how the data
are collected, not in the model. Trait-cell labels collected within a single session conflate disease state with
stable subject features (aperiodic 1/f being one identifiable carrier on LaBraM and CBraMod). To separate
the two, the label must change within a subject. Only then does its discriminative axis fall outside the
between-subject subspace that LEACE erases. Some labels allow this: when the underlying state changes
over time, recording each subject under both conditions captures the variation. Other labels do not: a
dementia diagnosis is a fixed subject attribute, so no recording protocol can separate it from identity. For
these labels the entanglement is irreducible at the representation level, and the discriminative features must
instead be validated as physiological rather than biometric. Scaling model capacity helps in neither case.

Preprint 20
Brain–computer-interface calibration claims should pass a within-subject direction-consistency check before
any subject-independent generalization is asserted; a cell like SleepDep, where contrasts are idiosyncratic
within each subject, can support high in-subject calibration accuracy with near-zero cross-subject transfer.
These assessments also depend on reading the diagnostics jointly: the SleepDep assessment is recoverable
only from the disagreement pattern across tools, not from any single one. Building on the established
subject-disjoint splitting culture in EEG (Brookshire et al., 2024; Lotte et al., 2018), the assessment matrix
turns this into a frozen-feature pre-pilot test: whether the features show the geometric signatures (subject
dominance, aperiodic anchoring, axis disagreement) that predict cross-subject failure before any fine-tuning
compute is committed.
5.5 Limitations and scope
We note five limitations to the present claims. (i) Our 2×2 layout relies on one dataset per cell; consequently,
althoughtheFMScopeframeworkisgeneralizable,thespecificcell-levelclinicalobservationsremainempirical
features of these four cohorts and await broader validation. (ii) All four cells are small by machine-learning
standards (Stress N =17 subjects; EEGMAT and SleepDep N =36; ADFTD N =65); we mitigate seed
sensitivitywith3-seedFTand8-seedLP,butper-cellconfidenceintervalsarewideandpointwisecomparisons
across cells are descriptive. The Mann–Whitney U is computed across 12 (cell × FM) points drawn from four
independentcells;thecolumnclaimrestsonthenon-overlappingeffect-sizeranges(+0.6to+8.4ppvs−1.9to
+0.8pp),whichthetestsummarizes. (iii)Ourablationsareinput-levelinterventions; theyestablishstatistical
entanglement between aperiodic 1/f and subject identity, not a causal mechanism. The aperiodic-anchor
effect holds on LaBraM and CBraMod but not on REVE, and these two groups differ along at least five
concurrentdesignaxesthatwecannotfactoriallyseparateinanN=3modelpanel: (a)thepresenceofspectral
processing in the pretraining pipeline (LaBraM’s encoder targets discrete codes whose decoder reconstructs
Fourier amplitude+phase; CBraMod’s patch embedding adds an FFT-derived branch to a temporal CNN;
REVEoperatesonrawsignalthroughout); (b)reconstructionloss(CBraMod’sMSEversusREVE’sexplicitly
motivated L1, chosen by El Ouahidi et al. (2025) to avoid L2 amplification of high-amplitude EEG content);
(c) pretraining corpus diversity (REVE’s 25,000 subjects across 92 heterogeneous datasets versus CBraMod’s
∼15,000 subjects from a single clinical source); (d) positional encoding (REVE’s 4D Fourier sinusoidal versus
learned or convolutional alternatives); (e) an attention-pooling secondary task that REVE adds and the
other two omit. We therefore report the two-versus-one pattern descriptively, not as a mechanism claim; an
architecture-level controlled ablation would be required to isolate any single axis. (iv) All analyses assume
subject-disjoint cross-validation, recording-level labels, and a ≥19-channel 10–20 montage; cells with finer
label resolution or trial-level splitting may produce different readings. The DASS-21 self-report on Stress
(Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995) is a past-week screener, and we adopt the per-recording binarization of
Komarovetal.(2020)forcross-protocolcomparabilitywithWangetal.(2025b); oursubject-disjointnumbers
reproduce that work’s protocol-side configuration but apply each FM’s release-default fine-tuning recipe
rather than a per-dataset hyperparameter sweep. (v) Single-session ADFTD cannot separate disease state
from stable subject traits by data alone. The diagnosis is a fixed subject attribute and does not change
within a subject, so collecting more sessions would not separate them either. For such labels the limit is
intrinsic, and the discriminative features must be validated against external physiological evidence rather
than addressed with more recordings. We did not pre-align signals using Riemannian or Euclidean alignment
methods before fine-tuning. This engineering step may attenuate the subject-axis amplification and is a
natural follow-up, but it is not a prerequisite for the diagnostic claim itself.
5.6 Future directions
We see three algorithmic directions following from the bottleneck reading: FOOOF-detrended pretraining
(the causal test of whether aperiodic 1/f is the masked objective’s primary subject carrier), explicit gradient-
reversal objectives at fine-tuning (Ganin and Lempitsky, 2015) that could augment existing general-purpose
SSL pretraining recipes for EEG (Banville et al., 2021; Kostas et al., 2021), and explicit cross-subject
alignment regularization at pretraining. On the empirical side, replication with a second dataset per cell, a

Preprint 21
layer-wise FOOOF-aperiodic probe, a broader FM panel that varies the five design axes independently, and a
within-subject paired protocol on a no-consensus label would sharpen the present descriptive observations
into axis-level claims. Integrating FMScope-style diagnostics into large-scale community benchmarks
(Aristimunha et al., 2025; Kastrati et al., 2025; Shen et al., 2026) would complement leaderboard accuracy
with a representation-level check that distinguishes models rewarded for learning clinical biomarkers from
those rewarded for optimizing subject-specific aperiodic anchors. The diagnostic framework we report here
characterizes the substrate; pretraining-objective work is the path that moves the substrate.
6 Conclusion
Subject-disjoint cross-validation is necessary but not sufficient for representation discovery in small-N clinical
resting-state EEG. Across the 12 (cell, FM) pairs we examined, the frozen embedding already placed subject
identity on its largest-variance direction, and fine-tuning amplified that direction whether or not the label
aligned with it; a high accuracy is therefore consistent either with a transferable clinical biomarker or with
subject identity that merely co-varies with the label in this cohort, and accuracy alone cannot separate the
two. FMScope is a frozen-feature pre-flight check, complementary to subject-disjoint splitting, that tells
the user before any fine-tuning whether a cell’s representation carries label-aligned biological structure or
subject identity dressed up as a label. Where it signals an information deficit rather than a capacity limit,
the remedy is methodological: a within-subject label should be recorded under both conditions so that its
discriminative axis separates from between-subject identity, whereas a label fixed at the subject level cannot
be disentangled by any protocol, and its discriminative features must instead be shown to correspond to
an independently established physiological marker rather than to incidental subject traits. The framework
generalizes; the per-cell outcomes are empirical features of these four cohorts and three FMs, and broader
validation awaits future cohorts.

PERMANOVA on SleepDep is significant on every (FM, state) pair even though ∆f is negative
label
across all three FMs. This is consistent with the within-subject paired design: each pair block is anchored to
one subject, and the per-pair contrast leaves a label-detectable signature in the cosine geometry whether

or not fine-tuning amplifies it. We therefore use PERMANOVA as a within-cell detector of label-related
structure rather than as the axis-level test; the consensus-vs-no-consensus contrast is given by the ∆f
label
Mann–Whitney U above. On Stress, PERMANOVA shows no effect on any (FM, state) pair, which supports
the below-linear-probe-resolution assessment (Tab. 4) without relying on the layer-wise probe alone.
