Abstract
Objective. Supervised learning paradigms are often limited by the amount of labeled data
that is available. This phenomenon is particularly problematic in clinically-relevant data,
such as electroencephalography (EEG), where labeling can be costly in terms of specialized
expertise and human processing time. Consequently, deep learning architectures designed to
learn on EEG data have yielded relatively shallow models and performances at best similar
to those of traditional feature-based approaches. However, in most situations, unlabeled data
is available in abundance. By extracting information from this unlabeled data, it might be
possibletoreachcompetitiveperformancewithdeepneuralnetworksdespitelimitedaccessto
labels. Approach. We investigated self-supervised learning (SSL), a promising technique for
discovering structure in unlabeled data, to learn representations of EEG signals. Specifically,
we explored two tasks based on temporal context prediction as well as contrastive predictive
coding on two clinically-relevant problems: EEG-based sleep staging and pathology detection.
We conducted experiments on two large public datasets with thousands of recordings and
performed baseline comparisons with purely supervised and hand-engineered approaches.
Main results. Linear classifiers trained on SSL-learned features consistently outperformed

monitoring seizures [2] and brain-computer interfacing [3]. In the last few years, the availability
and portability of these devices has increased dramatically, effectively democratizing their use
and unlocking the potential for positive impact on people’s lives [4, 5]. For instance, applications
such as at-home sleep staging and apnea detection, pathological EEG detection, mental workload
monitoring, etc. are now entirely possible.
Inallthesescenarios, monitoringmodalitiesgeneratesanever-increasingamountofdatawhich
needs to be interpreted. Therefore, predictive models that can classify, detect and ultimately
“understand” physiological data are required. Traditionally, this type of modelling has mostly
relied on supervised approaches, where large datasets of annotated examples are required to train
models with high performance.
However, obtaining accurate annotations on physiological data can prove expensive, time
consuming or simply impossible. For example, annotating sleep recordings requires trained
technicians to go through hours of data visually and label 30-s windows one-by-one [6]. Clinical
recordingssuchasthoseusedtodiagnoseepilepsyorbrainlesionsmustbereviewedbyneurologists,
who might not always be available. More broadly, noise in the data and the complexity of brain
processes of interest can make it difficult to interpret and annotate EEG signals, which can
lead to high inter-rater variability, i.e., label noise [7, 8]. Furthermore, in some cases, knowing
exactly what the participants were thinking or doing in cognitive neuroscience experiments can be
challenging, making it hard to obtain accurate labels. In imagery tasks, for instance, the subjects
might not be following instructions or the process under study might be difficult to quantify
objectively (e.g., meditation, emotions). Therefore, a new paradigm that does not rely primarily
on supervised learning is necessary for making use of large unlabeled sets of recordings such as
those generated in the scenarios described above. However, traditional unsupervised learning
approaches such as clustering and latent factor models do not offer fully satisfying answers as
their performance is not as straightforward to quantify and interpret as supervised ones.
“Self-supervised learning” (SSL) is an unsupervised learning approach that learns representa-
tions from unlabeled data, exploiting the structure of the data to provide supervision [9]. By
reframing an unsupervised learning problem as a supervised one, SSL allows the use of standard,
better understood optimization procedures. SSL comprises a “pretext” and a “downstream” task.
The downstream task is the task one is actually interested in but for which there are limited or no
annotations. The pretext task, on the other hand, must be sufficiently related to the downstream
task such that similar representations should be employed to carry it out; importantly, it must be
possible to generate the annotations for this pretext task using the unlabeled data alone. For
example, in a computer vision scenario, one could use a jigsaw puzzle task where patches are
extracted from an image, scrambled randomly and then fed to a neural network that is trained
to recover the original spatial ordering of the patches [10]. If the network performs this task
reasonably well, then it is conceivable that it has learned some of the structure of natural images,
and that the trained network could be reused as a feature extractor or weight initialization on a
smaller-scale supervised learning problem such as object recognition. Apart from facilitating the
downstream task and/or reducing the number of necessary annotated examples, self-supervision
can also uncover more general and robust features than those learned in a specialized supervised
task [11]. Therefore, given the potential benefits of SSL, can it be used to enhance the analysis of
EEG?
To date, most applications of SSL have focused on domains where plentiful annotated data is
alreadyavailable,suchascomputervision[9]andnaturallanguageprocessing[12,13]. Particularly
in computer vision, deep networks are often trained with fully supervised tasks (e.g., ImageNet
2

pretraining). In this case, enough labeled data is available such that direct supervised learning
on the downstream task is already in itself competitive [14]. SSL has an even greater potential in
domains where low-labeled data regimes are common and supervised learning’s effectiveness is
limited, e.g. biosignal and EEG processing. Despite this, few studies on SSL and biosignals have
been published. These studies either focus on limited downstream tasks and datasets [15], or test
their approach on signals other than EEG [16].
Therefore, it still remains to be shown whether self-supervision can truly bring improvements
over standard supervised approaches on EEG, and if this is the case, what the best ways of
applyingitare. Specifically, canwelearngenericrepresentationsofEEGwithself-supervisionand,
in doing so, reduce the need for costly EEG annotations? Given the growing popularity of deep
learning as a processing tool for EEG [17], the answer could have a significant impact on current
practices in the field of EEG processing. Indeed, while deep learning is notoriously data-hungry,
an overwhelmingly large part of all neuroscience research happens in the low-labeled data regime,
including EEG research: clinical studies with a few hundred subjects are often considered to be
big data, while large-scale studies are much rarer and usually originate from research consortia
[18, 19, 20, 21]. Therefore, it is to be expected that the performance reported by most deep
learning-EEG studies - often in low-labeled data regimes - has so far remained limited and does
not clearly outperform those of conventional approaches [17]. By leveraging unlabeled data, SSL
can effectively create a lot more examples, which could enable more successful applications of
deep learning to EEG.
In this paper, we investigate the use of self-supervision as a general approach to learning
representations from EEG data. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first detailed
analysis of SSL tasks on multiple types of EEG recordings. We aim to answer the following
questions:
1. What are good SSL tasks that capture relevant structure in EEG data?
2. How do SSL features compare to other unsupervised and supervised approaches in terms of
downstream classification performance?
3. What are the characteristics of the features learned by SSL? Specifically, can SSL capture
physiologically- and clinically-relevant structure from unlabeled EEG?
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the SSL
literature, then describes the different SSL tasks and learning problems considered in our study.
We also introduce the neural architectures, baseline methods and data used in our experiments.
Next, Section 3 reports the results of our experiments on EEG. Lastly, we discuss the results in
Section 4.
2 Methods
2.1 State-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches
Although it has not always been known as such, SSL has already been used in many other
fields. In computer vision, multiple approaches have been proposed that rely on the spatial
structure of images and the temporal structure of videos. For example, a context prediction task
was used to train feature extractors on unlabeled images in [22] by predicting the position of a
randomly sampled image patch relative to a second patch. Using this approach to pretrain a
3

neural network, the authors reported improved performance as compared to a purely supervised
model on the Pascal VOC object detection challenge. These results were among the first showing
that self-supervised pretraining could help improve performance when limited annotated data is
available. Similarly, the jigsaw puzzle task mentioned above [10] led to improved downstream
performance on the same dataset. In the realm of video processing, approaches based on temporal
structure have also been proposed: for instance, in [23], predicting whether a sequence of video
frames were ordered or shuffled was used as a pretext task and tested on a human activity
recognition downstream task. The interested reader can find other applications of SSL to images
in [9].
Similarly, modern natural language processing (NLP) tasks often rely on self-supervision to
learn word embeddings, which are at the core of many applications [24]. For instance, the original
word2vec model was trained to predict the words around a center word or a center word based on
the words around it [12], and then reused on a variety of downstream tasks [25]. More recently, a
dual-task self-supervised approach, BERT, led to state-of-the-art performance on 11 NLP tasks
such as question answering and named entity recognition [13]. The high performance achieved by
this approach showcases the potential of SSL for learning general-purpose representations.
Lately, more general pretext tasks as well as improved methodology have led to strong results
that have begun to rival purely supervised approaches. For instance, contrastive predictive coding
(CPC), an autoregressive prediction task in latent space, was successfully used for images, text
and speech [11]. Given an encoder and an autoregressive model, the task consists of predicting
the output of the encoder for future windows (or image patches or words) given a context of
multiple windows. The authors presented several improved results on various downstream tasks;
a follow-up further showed that higher-capacity networks could improve downstream performance
even more, especially in low-labeled data regimes [26]. Momentum contrast (MoCo), rather than
proposing a new pretext task, is an improvement upon contrastive tasks, i.e., where a classifier
must predict which of two or more inputs is the true sample [27, 28]. By improving the sampling
of negative examples in contrastive tasks, MoCo helped boost the efficiency of SSL training as
well as the quality of the representations learned. Similarly, it was found in [29] that using the
right data augmentation transforms (e.g., random cropping and color distortion on images) and
increasing batch size could lead to significant improvements in downstream performance.
The ability of SSL-trained features to demonstrably generalize to downstream tasks justifies
a closer look at their statistical structure. A general and theoretically grounded approach was
recently formalized by Hyvärinen et al. [30, 31] from the perspective of nonlinear independent
components analysis. In this generalized framework, an observation x is embedded using an
invertible neural network, and contrasted against an auxiliary variable u (e.g., the time index, the
index of a segment or the history of the data). A discriminator classifies the pair by learning to
predict whether x is paired with its corresponding auxiliary variable u or a perturbed (random)
one u∗. When the data exhibits certain structure (e.g., autocorrelation, non-stationarity, non-
gaussianity), the embedder trained on this contrastive task will perform identifiable nonlinear
ICA [31]. Most of the previously introduced SSL tasks can be viewed through this framework.
Given the widespread use of linear ICA as a preprocessing and feature extraction tool in the EEG
community [32, 33, 34, 35], an extension to the nonlinear regime is a natural step forward and
could help improve traditional processing pipelines.
Remarkably, very few studies have applied SSL to biosignals despite its potential to leverage
large quantities of unlabeled data. In [15], a model inspired by word2vec, called wave2vec, was
developed to work with EEG and electrocardiography (ECG) time series. Representations were
4

learned by predicting the features of neighbouring windows from the concatenation of time-
frequency representations of EEG signals and demographic information. This approach was
however only tested on a single EEG dataset and was not benchmarked against fully supervised
deep learning approaches or expert feature classification. SSL has also been applied to ECG as
a way to learn features for a downstream emotion recognition task: in [16], a transformation
discrimination pretext task was used in which the model had to predict which transformations
had been applied to the raw signal. While these results show the potential of self-supervised
learning for biosignals, a more extensive analysis of SSL targeted at EEG is required to pave the
| way for practical   | applications. |          |         |       |         |     |     |

In this section, we describe the three SSL pretext tasks used in the paper. A visual explanation

p,q ∈ N. The index t refers to time indices in the multiva riat e time series S ∈ RC×M, where M
is the number of time samples and C is the dimension of samples (e.g., channels). We assume for
simplicity that each S has the same size. We denote by y ∈ {−1,1} a binary label used in the
| learning       | task. |             |     |     |     |     |     |

To produce labeled samples from the multivariate time series S, we propose to sample pairs

window, and where the index t indicates the time sample at which the window starts in S. The
first window x is referred to as the “anchor window”. Our assumption is that an appropriate
t
representation of the data should evolve slowly over time (akin to the driving hypothesis behind
Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) [36, 37]) suggesting that time windows close in time should share
the same label. In the context of sleep staging, for instance, sleep stages usually last between 1
to 40 minutes [38]; therefore, nearby windows likely come from the same sleep stage, whereas
N,
faraway windows likely come from different sleep stages. Given τ ∈ which controls the

We ignore window pairs where x falls outside of the positive and negative contexts of the
t(cid:48)
anchor window x . In other words, the label indicates whether two time windows are closer
t
together than τ pos or farther apart than τ neg in time. Noting the connection with the task in [22],
| we call | this | pretext | task “relative |     | positioning” |     | (RP). |     |     |     |     |

position, we introduce two functions h and g . h : → is a feature extractor with

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
parameters Θ which maps a window x to its representation in the feature space. Ultimately, we
expect h to learn an informative representation of the raw EEG input which can be reused
Θ
in different downstream tasks. A contrastive module g is then used to aggregate the feature

representations of each window. For the RP task, g RP : → combines representations
from pairs of windows by computing an elementwise absolute difference, denoted by the |·|
operator: g (h (x),h (x(cid:48))) = |h (x)−h (x(cid:48))| ∈ RD. The role of g is to aggregate the

simplify the contrastive task. Finally, a linear context discriminative model with coefficients
w ∈ RD and bias term w ∈ R is responsible for predicting the associated target y. Using the

We also introduce a variation of the RP task that we call “temporal shuffling” (TS), in which we
instead sample two anchor windows x and x from the positive context, and a third window x
|     |     |     |     |     | t   |     | t(cid:48)(cid:48) |     |     |     | t(cid:48) |

that is either between the first two windows or in the negative context. We then construct window
triplets that are either temporally ordered (t < t(cid:48) < t(cid:48)(cid:48)) or shuffled (t < t(cid:48)(cid:48) < t(cid:48) or t(cid:48) < t < t(cid:48)(cid:48)).
We augment the number of possible triplets by also considering the mirror image of the previous
triplets, e.g., (x ,x t(cid:48) ,x t(cid:48)(cid:48) ) becomes (x t(cid:48)(cid:48) ,x t(cid:48) ,x ). The label y then indicates whether the three

The contrastive predictive coding (CPC) pretext task, introduced by Oord et al. [11], is defined
here in comparison to RP and TS, as all three tasks share key similarities. Indeed, CPC can be
seen as an extension of RP, where the single anchor window x t is replaced by a sequence of N c non-
overlapping windows that are summarized by an autoregressive encoder g : RD×Nc → RDAR

with parameters Θ 2. This way, the information in the context can be represented by a single
AR
vector c
t
∈ RDAR. g
AR
can be implemented for example as a recurrent neural network with
gated-recurrent units (GRU).
The context vector c is paired with not one, but N future windows (or “steps”) which
t p
immediately follow the context. Negative windows are then sampled in a similar way as with
RP and TS when τ = 0, i.e., the negative context is relaxed to include the entire time series.
neg
For each future window, N negative windows x∗ are sampled inside each multivariate time
b
series S (“same-recording negative sampling”) or across all available S (“across-recording negative
sampling”). For the sake of simplicity and to follow the notation of the original CPC article, we
modify our notation slightly: we now denote a time window by x where t is the index of the
t
window in the list of all non-overlapping windows of size T that can be extracted from a time
series S. Therefore, the procedure for building a dataset with N examples boils down to sampling
sequences Xc, Xp and Xn in the following manner:
Xc = (x ,...,x ) (N context windows)
i ti−Nc+1 ti c
Xp = (x ,...,x ) (N future windows)
i ti+1 ti+Np p
X i n = (x t∗ ,...,x t∗ ,...,x t∗ ,...,x t∗ ) (N p N b random negative windows)
i1,1 i1,Nb iNp,1 iNp,Nb
where t ∈ N ,M −N . We denote with t∗ time indices of windows sampled uniformly at
i c p
(cid:74) (cid:75)
random. The dataset then reads:
Z = {(Xc,Xp,Xn) | i ∈ N } . (4)
N i i i
(cid:74) (cid:75)
As with RP and TS, the feature extractor h is used to extract a representation of size D
Θ
from a window x . Finally, whereas the contrastive modules g and g explicitly relied on
t RP TS
the absolute value of the difference between embeddings h, here for each future window x

where k ∈ N

a bilinear model f

the window chronologically follows the context c or not:

k t Θ t+k Θ t+k k t
The whole CPC model is trained end-to-end using the InfoNCE loss [11] (a categorical
cross-entropy loss) defined as
L(Θ,Θ ,W ,...,W ) =

While in RP and TS the model must predict whether a pair is positive or negative, in CPC

2.3 Downstream tasks
WeperformedempiricalbenchmarksofEEG-basedSSLontwoclinicalproblemsthatarerepresen-
tative of the current challenges in machine learning-based analysis of EEG: sleep monitoring and
pathology screening. These two clinical problems commonly give rise to classification tasks, albeit
with different numbers of classes and distinct data-generating mechanisms: sleep monitoring
is concerned with biological events (event level) while pathology screening is concerned with
single patients as compared to the population (subject level). These two clinical problems have
generated considerable attention in the research community, which has led to the curation of
large public databases. To enable fair comparisons with supervised approaches, we benchmarked
SSL on the Physionet Challenge 2018 [1, 39] and the TUH Abnormal EEG [40] datasets.
First, we considered sleep staging, which is a critical component of a typical sleep monitoring
assessment and is key to diagnosing and studying sleep disorders such as apnea and narcolepsy
[41]. Sleep staging has been extensively studied in the machine (and deep) learning literature
[42, 43, 17] (approximately 10% of reviewed papers in [17]), though not through the lens of SSL.
Achieving fully automated sleep staging could have a substantial impact on clinical practice
as (1) agreement between human raters is often limited [7] and (2) the annotation process
is time-consuming and still largely manual [6]. Sleep staging typically gives rise to a 5-class
classification problem where the possible predictions are W (wake), N1, N2, N3 (different levels
of sleep) and R (rapid eye movement periods). Here, the task consists of predicting the sleep
stages that correspond to 30-s windows of EEG.
Second, we applied SSL to pathology detection: EEG is routinely used in a clinical context to
screen individuals for neurological conditions such as epilepsy and dementia [44, 45]. However,
successfulpathologydetectionrequireshighlyspecializedmedicalexpertiseanditsqualitydepends
on the expert’s training and experience. Automated pathology detection could, therefore, have
a major impact on clinical practice by facilitating neurological screening. This gives rise to
classification tasks at the subject level where the challenge is to infer the patient’s diagnosis or
health status from the EEG recording. In the TUH dataset, medical specialists have labeled
recordings as either pathological or non-pathological, giving rise to a binary classification problem.
Importantly, these two labels reflect highly heterogeneous situations: a pathological recording
could reflect anomalies due to various medical conditions, suggesting a rather complex data-
generating mechanism. Again, various supervised approaches, some of them leveraging deep
architectures, have addressed this task in the literature [46, 47, 48], although none has relied on
self-supervision.
These two tasks are further described in Section 2.6 when discussing the data used in our
experiments.
2.4 Deep learning architectures
We used two different deep learning architectures as embedders h in our experiments (see Fig. 2
Θ
for a detailed description). Both architectures were convolutional neural networks composed of
spatial and temporal convolution layers, which respectively learned to perform the spatial and
temporal filtering operations typical of EEG processing pipelines.
The first one, which we call StagerNet, was adapted from previous work on sleep staging
where it was shown to perform well for window-wise classification of sleep stages [42]. StagerNet
is a 3-layer convolutional neural network optimized to process windows of 30s of multichannel
EEG. As opposed to the original architecture, (1) we used twice as many convolutional channels
9

(16 instead of 8), (2) we added batch normalization after both temporal convolution layers3 (3)
we did not pad temporal convolutions and (4) we changed the dimensionality of the output layer
to D = 100 instead of the number of classes (see Fig. 2-1). This yielded a total of 62,307 trainable
parameters.
The second embedder architecture, ShallowNet, was directly taken from previous literature
on the TUH Abnormal dataset [47, 48]. Originally designed to be a parametrized version of the
filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) processing pipeline common in brain-computer
interfacing, ShallowNet has a single (split) convolutional layer followed by a squaring non-linearity,
average pooling, a logarithm non-linearity, and a linear output layer. Batch normalization was
used after the temporal convolution layer. Despite its simplicity, this architecture was shown
in [48] to perform almost as well as the best model on the task of pathology detection on the
TUH Abnormal dataset. We therefore used it as is, except for the dimensionality of the output
layer which we also changed to D = 100 (See Fig. 2-2). This yielded a total of 170,860 trainable
parameters.

on both datasets.
The Adam optimizer [50] with β = 0.9 and β = 0.999 and learning rate 5×10−4 was used.
1 2
The batch size for all deep models was set to 256, except for CPC where it was set to 32. Training
ran for at most 150 epochs or until the validation loss stopped decreasing for a period of a least
10 epochs (or 6 epochs for CPC). Dropout was applied to fully connected layers at a rate of 50%
and a weight decay of 0.001 was applied to the trainable parameters of all layers. Finally, the
parameters of all neural networks were randomly initialized using uniform He initialization [51].
2.5 Baselines
The SSL tasks were compared to four baseline approaches on the downstream tasks: (1) random
weights, (2) convolutional autoencoders, (3) purely supervised learning and (4) handcrafted
features.
The random weights baseline used an embedder whose weights were frozen after random
initialization. The autoencoder (AE) was a more basic approach to representation learning, where
a neural network made up of an encoder and a decoder learned an identity mapping between
its input and its output, penalized by e.g., a mean squared error loss [52]. Here, we used h as
Θ
the encoder and designed a convolutional decoder that inverts the operations of h . The purely
Θ
supervised model was directly trained on the downstream classification problem, i.e., it had access
to the labeled data. To do so, we added an additional linear classification layer to the embedder,
before training the whole model with a multi-class cross-entropy loss.
Finally, we also included traditional machine learning baselines based on handcrafted features.
For sleep staging, we extracted the following features [42]: mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis,
standard deviation, frequency log-power bands between (0.5, 4.5, 8.5, 11.5, 15.5, 30) Hz as well
as all their possible ratios, peak-to-peak amplitude, Hurst exponent, approximate entropy and
Hjorth complexity. This resulted in 37 features per EEG channel, which were concatenated into a
single vector. In the event of an artefact causing missing values in the feature vector of a window,
we imputed missing values feature-wise using the mean of the feature computed over the training
3As described in [11, 27], batch normalization can harm the network’s ability to learn on the CPC pretext
task. However, we did not see this effect on our models (likely because their capacity is relatively small) and
alternatives such as no normalization or layer normalization [49] performed unfavorably. Therefore, we also used
batch normalization in CPC experiments.

reported that a nonlinear classifier trained on tangent space features reached high accuracy on
the evaluation set of the TUH Abnormal dataset. We did not average the covariance matrices per
recording to allow a fair comparison with the other methods which work window-wise. Therefore,
for C channels of EEG, the input to the classifier had dimensionality C(C +1)/2.

First, we conducted sleep staging experiments on the Physionet Challenge 2018 (PC18) dataset
[1, 39]. This dataset was initially released in the context of an open-source competition on the
detection of arousals in sleep recordings, i.e., short moments of wakefulness during the night. A
total of 1,983 different individuals with (suspected) sleep apnea were monitored overnight and
their EEG, EOG, chin EMG, respiration airflow and oxygen saturation measured. Specifically,
6 EEG channels from the international 10/20 system were recorded at 200 Hz: F3-M2, F4-M1,
C3-M2, C4-M1, O1-M2 and O2-M1. The recorded data was then annotated by 7 trained scorers
following the AASM manual [58] into sleep stages (W, N1, N2, N3 and R). Moreover, 9 different
types of arousal and 4 types of sleep apnea events were identified in the recordings. As the sleep
stage annotations are only publicly available on about half the recordings (used as the training
set during the competition), we focused our analysis on these 994 recordings. In this subset of
the data, mean age is 55 years old (min: 18, max: 93) and 33% of participants are female.

more from 2,329 different patients who underwent a clinical EEG in a hospital setting. Each
recording was labeled as “normal” (1,385 recordings) or “abnormal” (998 recordings) based on
detailed physician reports. Most recordings were sampled at 250 Hz (although some were sampled
at 256 or 512 Hz) and contained between 27 and 36 electrodes. Moreover, the corpus is divided
into a training and an evaluation set with 2,130 and 253 recordings each. The mean age across

We split the available recordings from PC18 and TUHab into training, validation and testing sets
such that the examples from each recording were only in one of the sets (see Table 3).
For PC18, we used a 60-20-20% random split, meaning there were 595, 199 and 199 recordings
in the training, validation and testing sets respectively. For RP and TS, 2,000 pairs or triplets of
windows were sampled from each recording. For CPC, the number of batches to extract from
each recording was computed as 0.05 times the number of windows in that recording; moreover,

For TUHab, we used the provided evaluation set as the test set. The recordings of the
development set were split 80-20% into a training and a validation set. Therefore, we used 2,171,
543 and 276 recordings in the training, validation and testing sets. Since the recordings were
shorter for TUHab, we randomly sampled 400 RP pairs or TS triplets instead of 2000 from each

2.6.4 Preprocessing
ThepreprocessingoftheEEGrecordingsdifferedforthetwodatasets. OnPC18,therawEEGwas
first filtered using a 30Hz FIR lowpass filter with a Hamming window, to reject higher frequencies
that are not critical for sleep staging [42, 59]. The EEG channels were then downsampled to
100Hz to reduce the dimensionality of the input data. For the same reason, we focused our
analysis on channels F3-M2 and F4-M1. Lastly, non-overlapping windows of 30s of size (3000 x
2) were extracted.
On TUHab, a similar procedure to the one reported in [48] was used. The first minute of each
recording was cropped to remove noisy data that occurs at the beginning of recordings. Longer
files were also cropped such that a maximum of 20 minutes was used from each recording. Then,
21 channels that are common to all recordings were selected (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F8, F3, Fz, F4, A1,
T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, A2, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1 and O2). EEG channels were downsampled to
100Hz and clipped at ±800µV to mitigate the effect of large artifactual deflections in the raw
data. Non-overlapping 6-s windows were extracted, yielding windows of size (600×21).
Finally, windows from both datasets with peak-to-peak amplitude below 1µV were rejected.
The remaining windows were normalized channel-wise to have zero-mean and unit standard
deviation.

3 Results
We investigated the use of SSL tasks to learn useful EEG features from unlabeled data in a series
of three experiments. First, SSL approaches were compared to fully supervised approaches based
on deep learning or handcrafted features. Second, we explored SSL-learned representations to
highlight clinically-relevant structure. Finally, in the last experiment, we studied the impact of
hyperparameter selection on pretext and downstream performance.
3.1 SSL models learn representations of EEG and facilitate downstream tasks
with limited annotated data
Can the suggested pretext tasks enable SSL on clinical EEG data and mitigate the amount
of labeled EEG data that is required in clinical tasks? To address this question, we applied
the pretext tasks to two clinical datasets (PC18 and TUHab) and compared their downstream
performance to the one of various established approaches such as fully supervised learning, while
varying the number of labeled examples available.
Context and setup. Feature extractors h were trained using the different approaches (AE,
Θ
RP, TS and CPC on unlabeled data) and then used to extract features. Following hyperparameter
search (see Section 3.3), we used same-recording negative sampling on PC18 and across-recording
negative sampling on TUHab. We also extracted features with randomly initialized models.
Downstream task performance was then evaluated by training linear logistic regression models
on labeled examples, where the training set contains at least one and up to all existing labeled
examples. Additionally, fully supervised models were trained directly on labeled data and random
forests were trained on handcrafted features.
The impact of the number of labeled samples on downstream performance is presented in
Fig. 3. First, when using SSL-learned features for the downstream tasks, we observe important
above-chance performance across all data regimes: on PC18, our models scored as high as
72.3% balanced accuracy (5-class, chance=20%) while on TUHab the highest performance was
of 79.4% (2-class, chance=50%). These results demonstrate the ability of SSL to learn useful
representations for our downstream tasks. Second, the comparison suggests that SSL-learned
features are competitive with other baseline approaches and can even outperform supervised
approaches. On the PC18 sleep data (Fig. 3A), one can observe that all three SSL pretext
tasks outperformed alternative approaches including the fully supervised model and handcrafted
features in most data regimes. The performance gap between SSL-learned features and full
supervision was as high as 22.8 points when only one example per class was available. It remained
in favor of SSL up to around 10,000 examples per class, where full supervision finally began to
exceed SSL performance, however by a 1.6-3.5% margin only. Moreover, SSL outperformed the
handcrafted features baseline over 100 examples per class, e.g., by up to 5.6 points for CPC. These
results suggest two important implications: (1) our pretext tasks can capture critical information
for sleep staging, even though no sleep labels were available when learning representations and
(2) these features can rival both human-engineered features and label-intensive full supervision.
Other baselines such as random weights and autoencoding obtained much lower performance,
showing that learning informative features for sleep staging is not trivial and requires more
sophistication than the inductive bias of a convolutional neural network alone or a pure recon-
struction task. Interestingly, the poor performance of the AE can be attributed to its mean
squared error loss. This encourages the model to focus on the signal’s low frequencies, which, due
to 1/f power-law dynamics have the largest amplitudes in biosignals like EEG. Yet, low frequency

extractors were trained with an autoencoder (AE), the relative positioning (RP), temporal
shuffling (TS) and contrastive predictive coding (CPC) tasks, a fully supervised model, a model
with random weights and handcrafted features, on PC18 and on TUHab. “All” means all available
training examples were used. The same-recording negative sampling strategy was used for SSL
tasks on PC18, while the across-recording strategy was used on TUHab. Results are the average
of five runs with same initialization but different random selection of examples and shaded

performance, SSL models achieved much higher performance than a fully supervised model when
few labeled examples were available.
signals only capture a small portion of the neurobiological information in EEG signals.
Next, we applied SSL to the task of pathology detection, where the two classes (“normal”
and “abnormal”) are likely to be more heterogenous than the sleep staging classes. Again, SSL-
learned features outperformed the baseline approaches in most data regimes: CPC outperformed
full supervision when fewer than 10,000 labeled examples per class were available, while the
performance gap between the two methods was on the order of 1% when all examples were
available. Handcrafted features were also consistently outperformed by RP, TS and CPC, albeit
by a smaller amount (e.g., 3.8-4.8 point difference for CPC). Again, the AE and random weights
features could not compete with the other methods. Notably, the AE fared even worse on TUHab
and downstream performance never exceeded 53.0%.
Taken together, our results demonstrate that the proposed SSL pretext tasks were general
enough to enable two fundamentally different types of EEG classification problems. All SSL tasks
systematically outperformed or equaled other approaches in low-to-medium labeled data regimes
and remained competitive in a high labeled data regime.
3.2 SSL models capture physiologically and clinically meaningful features
While SSL-learned features yielded competitive performance on sleep staging and pathology
detection tasks, it is unclear what kind of structure was captured by SSL. To address this, we

Contour lines correspond to the density levels of the distribution across all stages and are used as

examined the embeddings by analyzing their relationship with the different annotations and
meta-data available in clinical datasets. We thus projected the 100-dimensional embeddings
obtained on PC18 and TUHab onto a two-dimensional representation using Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection (UMAP) [60] and using the best models as identified in Section 3.3.
This allows a qualitative analysis of the local and global structure of the SSL-learned features.
Results on sleep data are shown in Fig. 4. A structure that closely follows the different sleep
stages can be noticed in the embeddings of PC18 obtained with TS and CPC6. Upon inspection
of the distribution of examples from the different stages, clear groups emerged. They not only
corresponded to the labeled sleep stages, but they are also sequentially arranged: moving from
one end of the embedding to another, we can draw a trajectory that passes through W, N1, N2
and N3 sequentially. Stage R, finally, mostly overlaps with N1. These results are in line with
previous observations on the structure of the sleep-wakefulness continuum [61, 62].
Intuitively, the largest sources of variation in sleep EEG data are linked to changes in sleep
stages and the corresponding microstructure (e.g., slow waves, sleep spindles, etc.). Can we
expect other sources of variation to also be visible in the embeddings? To address this question,
we inspected clinical information available in PC18 along with the embeddings: apnea events and
subject age. The results are presented in Fig. 5. First, apnea-related structure can be seen in the
middle of the embeddings, overlapping with the area where stage N2 was prevalent (first column
of Fig. 5). At the same time, very few apnea events occurred at the extremities of the embedding,
for instance over W regions, naturally, but also over N3 regions. Although this structure likely
reflects the correlation between sleep stages, age and actual apnea-induced EEG patterns, this

binary labels (“apnea”, “pathological” and “gender”), we visualize the probability as heatmaps,
i.e., the color indicates the probability that the label is true (e.g., that a window in that region
of the embedding overlaps with an apnea annotation). For age, the subjects of each dataset
were divided into 9 quantiles, and the color indicates which group was the most frequent in each
bin. The features learned with the SSL tasks capture physiologically-relevant structure, such as
pathology, age, apnea and gender.
nonetheless shows the potential of SSL to learn features that relate to clinical phenomena. Second,
age structure was revelead in at least two distinct ways in the embeddings (second column of
Fig. 5). The first is related to sleep macrostructure, i.e., the sequence of sleep stages and their
relative length. Indeed, younger subjects were predominant over the R stage region, while older
subjects were more frequently found over the W region. This is in line with well-documented
phenomena such as increased sleep fragmentation and sleep onset latency in older individuals,
as well as a subtle reduction in REM sleep with age [63]. Concurrently, we also observe sleep
microstructure in the embeddings. For instance, looking at N2-N3 regions for the TS embedding,
older age groups are more likely to be found in the leftmost side of the blob, while younger
subjects are more likely to be found on its rightmost side. This suggests there is a difference
between the characteristics of N2-N3 sleep across age groups, e.g., related to sleep spindles [64].
Can this clinically-relevant structure also be learned on a different type of EEG recording?
We conducted a similar analysis for TUHab, this time focusing on pathology, age and gender.
Results are shown in columns 3-5 of Fig. 5B. The embeddings of both TS and CPC exhibited
a primary multi-cluster structure, with similar gradient-like structure inside each cluster7. For
instance, pathology-related structure was clearly exposed in the two embeddings (column 3),
with an increasing probability of the EEG being abnormal when moving from one end of the
different clusters to the other. Likewise, an age-related gradient emerged inside each cluster
(column 4), in a similar direction as the pathology gradient, while there is also a gender-associated
gradient that appeared orthogonal to the first two (last column). What do the different clusters
actually represent? We plotted experimental setup-related labels (the original number of EEG

channels and the measurement date of each recording) in Fig. 6. Each cluster was predominantly
composed of examples with a given number of channels and with a specific range of measurement
dates. This might suggest that the SSL tasks have partially learned the noise introduced by
data collection. For example, the TUHab dataset was collected over many years across different
sites, by different EEG technicians and with various EEG devices. Most likely, the impact of this
noise in the embedding could be mitigated by using more aggressive preprocessing (e.g., bandpass
filtering) or by sampling negative examples within recordings from the same cohort.
In conclusion, this experiment showed that SSL can encode clinically-relevant structure such
as sleep stages, pathology, age, apnea and gender information from EEG data, while revealing
interactions (such as young age and REM sleep), without any access to labels.
3.3 SSL pretext task hyperparameters strongly influence downstream task
performance
How should the various SSL pretext task hyperparameters be tuned to fully make use of self-
supervision in clinical EEG tasks? In this section, we describe how the hyperparameters of the
models used in the experiments above were tuned and study in detail the impact of some key
hyperparameters on downstream performance.

more details on the hyperparameter search procedure.
always performed above chance as reported in Section 3.1. Interestingly though, configurations
with high pretext performance did not necessarily lead to high downstream performance, which
highlights the necessity of appropriate hyperparameter selection.
In the next step, we examined the influence of the different hyperparameters on each pretext
task (rows of Fig. 7) to identify optimal configurations. First, we focused on the same-recording
negative sampling scenario, in which negative examples are sampled from the same recording as
the anchor window(s). With RP, increasing τ always made the pretext task harder. This is
pos

neg
Do these results hold when negative windows are sampled across all recordings? Interestingly,
the type of negative sampling has a considerable effect on downstream performance (columns 3
19

and 6 of Fig. 7). On sleep staging, downstream performance dropped significantly and degraded
faster as τ was increased, while the opposite effect could be seen on the pathology detection
pos
task (higher, more stable performance). This effect might be explained by the nature of the
downstream task: in sleep staging, major changes in the EEG occur inside a given recording,
therefore distinguishing between windows of a same recording is key to identifying sleep stages.
On the other hand, in pathology detection, each recording is given a single label (“normal” or
“pathological”) and so being able to know whether a window comes from the same recording
(necessarily with the same label) or from another one (possibly with the opposite label) intuitively
appears more useful. In other words, the distribution that is chosen for sampling negative
examples determines the kind of invariance that the network is forced to learn. Overall, similar
results hold for TS.
As for CPC, a similar analysis shows that while increasing the number of windows to predict
(“number of steps”) made the pretext task more difficult, predicting further ahead in the future
helped the embedder learn a better representation for sleep staging (bottom row of Fig. 7).
Were these results affected by the type of negative sampling as was the case for RP and TS?
Remarkably, the type of negative sampling had a minor effect on downstream performance on
sleep data (71.6 vs. 72.2% bal acc), but had a considerable effect on pathology detection (74.1 vs.
80.4%), akin to what was seen above on RP and TS. This result echoes the report of [11] where
subject-specific negative sampling led to the highest downstream performance on a phoneme
classification downstream task.
In this last experiment, we confirmed that our SSL pretext tasks are not trivial, and that
certain pretext task hyperparameters have a measurable impact on downstream performance.
4 Discussion
In this paper, we introduced self-supervised learning (SSL) as a way to learn representations on
EEG data. Specifically, we proposed two SSL tasks designed to capture structure in EEG data,
relative positioning (RP) and temporal shuffling (TS) and adapted a third approach, contrastive
predictive coding (CPC), to work on EEG data. We showed that these tasks can be used to
learn generic features which capture clinically relevant structure from unlabeled EEG, such as
sleep micro- and macrostructure and pathology. Moreover, we performed a rigorous comparison
of SSL methods to traditional unsupervised and supervised methods on EEG, and showed that
downstream classification performance can be significantly improved by using SSL, particularly
in low-labeled data regimes. These results hold for two large-scale EEG datasets comprising sleep
and pathological EEG data, both with thousands of recordings.
4.1 Using SSL to improve performance in semi-supervised scenarios
We showed that SSL can be used to improve downstream performance when a lot of unlabeled
data is available but the amount of labeled examples is limited, i.e., in a semi-supervised learning
scenario (see Section 4.1). For instance, CPC-learned features outperformed fully supervised
learning on sleep data by about 20% when only one labeled example per class was available.
Similarly, on the pathology detection task an improvement of close to 15% was obtained with
SSL when only 10 labeled examples per class were available. In practice, SSL has the potential to
become a common tool for boosting classification performance when annotations are expensive, a
common scenario when working with biosignals like EEG.
20

Can SSL be applied to any semi-supervised problem or is it limited to larger clinical datasets?
While the SSL pretext tasks included in this work are applicable to multivariate time series in
general, their successful application does require adequate recording length and dataset size. First,
the EEG recordings need to be sufficiently long so that a reasonable number of windows can be
sampled given the positive and negative contexts and the window length. For clinical recordings,
this is typically not an issue: sleep monitoring and pathology screening procedures both produce
recordings of tens of minutes to many hours, which largely suffice. It is noteworthy that while the
proposed SSL approaches have been developed using clinical data, they could be readily applied to
event-related EEG protocols, such as those encountered in cognitive psychology or brain-computer
interfacing experiments [65, 66]. Indeed, SSL could be applied to an entire recording without
explicitly taking into consideration the known events (e.g. stimuli, behavioral responses). This
critically depends on the availability of continuous recordings (rather than epoched data only,
as is the case in some public EEG datasets) including resting state baselines and between-trial
segments. Second, the current results may suggest large datasets are necessary to enable SSL on
EEG as analyses were based on two of the largest publicly available EEG datasets with thousands
of recordings each. However, similar results hold on much smaller datasets containing fewer than
100 recordings [67]. Intuitively, as long as the unlabeled dataset is representative of the variability
of the test data, representations that are useful for the pretext task should be transferable to a
related downstream task.
One might argue that the observed performance benefit of SSL is incremental as compared
to supervised approaches when the number of samples is moderate to large. Is investing in
the development of SSL-based EEG-analysis worth the effort? It is important to highlight that
our results present a proof of concept that opens the door to further developments, which may
lead to substantial improvements in performance. In this paper, we limited our experiments to
the linear evaluation protocol, where the downstream task is carried out by a linear classifier
trained on SSL-learned features, in order to focus on the properties of the learned representations.
Finetuning the parameters of the embedders on the downstream task [11, 68] could likely further
improve downstream performance. Preliminary experiments (not shown) suggested that a 3 to
4-point improvement can be obtained in some data regimes when finetuning the embedders and
that performance with all data points is as high as with a purely supervised model. However,
using nonlinear classifiers (here, random forests) as suggested in [11] on SSL-learned features did
not improve results, suggesting our downstream tasks might be sufficiently close to the pretext
task that the relevant information is already linearly accessible. Another potential opportunity
to improve downstream performance consists of using larger deep learning architectures. Due
to their sampling methodology, most SSL tasks can “create” a vast number of distinct examples
going far beyond the number of labeled examples typically available in a supervised task. For
instance, on PC18, our training set contained close to 5×105 labeled examples while for our
self-supervised tasks we chose to train our embedderson more than twice that number ofexamples
(to fit computational time requirements), though more could have been easily sampled. The much
higher number of available examples in SSL opens the door to using much larger deep neural
networks which require much larger sample sizes [26]. Given the relatively shallow architectures
currently used in deep learning and EEG research (on which we based our choice of architectures)
[17], SSL could be key to training deeper models and improving upon current state of the art on
various EEG tasks.
21

4.2 Sleep-wakefulness continuum and inter-rater reliability
We have demonstrated that the embeddings learned with SSL capture clinically-relevant informa-
tion. Sleep, pathology, age and gender information appeared as clear structure in the learned
feature space (see Fig. 4-5). The variety of metadata that is visible in the embeddings highlights
the capacity of the proposed SSL tasks to uncover important factors of variation in noisy biosignal
data such as EEG in a purely unsupervised manner. Critically though, this structure is not
discrete, but continuous. Indeed, sleep stages are not cleanly separated into five clusters (or two
clusters for normal and abnormal EEG), but instead the embeddings display a smooth continuum
of sleep-wakefulness (or of normal-abnormal EEG). Is this gradient-like structure meaningful, or is
it a mere artefact of our experimental setup? We argue that the continuous nature of SSL-learned
features is inherent to the neurophysiological phenomena under study. Conveniently, this offers
interesting opportunities to improve the analysis of physiological data.
While sleep EEG is routinely divided into discrete stages to be analyzed, its true nature is
likely continuous. For instance, the concept of sleep stages and the taxonomy that we know
today is the product of incremental standardization efforts in the sleep research community
[69, 70, 71, 58]. Although this categorization is convenient, critics still stress the limitations of
stage-based systems under the evidence of sub-stages of sleep and the interplay between micro-
and macrostructure [72]. Moreover, even trained experts using the same set of rules do not
perfectly agree on their predictions, showing that the definition of stages remains ambiguous:
in [7], an overall agreement of 82.6% was obtained between the predictions of more than 2,500
trained sleep scorers (even lower for N1, at 63.0%). Consequently, could a better representation of
sleepEEG, such asthe one learnedwithself-supervision, alleviate someof these challenges? While
previous research suggests sleep might indeed be measured using a continuous metric derived
from a supervised machine learning model [61] or a computational mean-field model [62], we
additionallydemonstratedthattherichfeaturespacelearnedwithSSLcansimultaneouslycapture
sleep-related structure and variability caused by age and apnea. Importantly, the data-driven
nature of the SSL representation alleviates the subjectivity of manual sleep staging. Overall,
this suggests SSL-learned representations could provide more fine-grained information about the
multiple factors at play during sleep and, in doing so, enable a more precise study of sleep.
Similarly, many EEG pathologies are described by a clinical classification system which
defines discrete subtypes of diseases or disorders, e.g., epilepsy [73, 74] and dementia [75]. As for
sleep EEG, inter-rater agreement is limited [48]. This suggests that there is an opportunity for
these pathologies to be interpreted as a continuum as well. Although our pathology detection
downstream task was a simple binary classification task, the clear pathology-associated gradient
capturedbyourSSLpretexttaskscouldbeusedtocharacterizethedifferenttypesandsubtypesof
pathologiescontainedinthedatasetmoreprecisely(seeFig.5). Ultimately,thedata-drivenfeature
space obtained with SSL might aid in the study and comparison of different neuropathologies
and EEG patterns in general.
4.3 Finding the right pretext task for EEG
With the large number of self-supervised pretext tasks one can think of, and the even larger
number of possible EEG downstream tasks, how can we choose a combination of pretext task and
hyperparameters for a given setting? To answer this question, many more empirical experiments
will have to be conducted on EEG data. However, the results presented here give some insight
as to what may be important to consider. In this work, we developed pretext tasks that proved
22

effective on two different classification problems by using a combination of (1) prior knowledge
about EEG time series, (2) assumptions about the statistical structure of the features to be
learned, (3) thorough hyperparameter search and (4) computational considerations.
First, we introduced and tailored to EEG the relative positioning (RP) and temporal shuffling
(TS) tasks by relying on prior knowledge about EEG. These tasks were designed specifically with
the structure of sleep data in mind. Indeed, sleep EEG signals have a clear temporal structure
originating from the succession of sleep stages during the night. This means that two windows
that are close in time have a high probability of sharing the same sleep stage annotation and
statistical structure. Therefore, learning to differentiate close-by from faraway windows should
intuitively be related to learning to differentiate sleep stages. Similar approaches were previously
described in the computer vision literature [22, 23], however they rely on properties of natural
images that generally do not hold for EEG. For instance, whereas two EEG windows x and x
t t(cid:48)
that are close in time likely look alike, there is typically no physiological information in these
windows that would allow one to determine whether t < t(cid:48) or t > t(cid:48).8 Therefore, tasks that
rely on proximity rather than absolute positioning appear to be a better match for EEG. As for
CPC, we included it in our experiments as it is a natural extension of RP and TS and has led to
promising results on other kinds of data [11].
Second, assumptions about the statistical structure of the latent factors or features to recover
was used to further support our choice of tasks. For instance, given its similarity with permutation
contrastive learning (PCL, a self-supervised method for performing nonlinear ICA [30]), RP likely
relies on the general temporal dependencies (including autocorrelations) of EEG signals to recover
informative features.9 Since TS and CPC can both be seen as extensions of the RP task with
more elaborate sampling strategies and contrastive procedures (see Section 2.2), all three tasks
might effectively rely on similar structure to discover features.
Third, the careful selection of pretext task hyperparameters was essential to selecting the
right pretext task configuration. For instance, RP, TS and CPC often yielded very similar
downstream task performance once the best hyperparameters were selected. Out of the main
pretext task hyperparameters, the negative sampling strategy proved to be especially important
to tune (Section 3.3). Indeed, sleep staging benefited from same-recording negative sampling
whereas pathology detection instead worked better when across-recording negative sampling was
used. Interestingly, this appears to be the unique change to RP, TS and CPC that is required
to compete with purely supervised approaches on the pathology detection downstream task,
although RP and TS were initially designed for capturing intra-recording sleep structure. Thus,
negative sampling hyperparameters might be among the most critical hyperparameters to tune,
as they can be used to develop invariances to particular structure that is not desirable, e.g.,
intra-recording changes or measurement-site effects (Fig. 6). Ultimately, the fact that all three
pretext tasks could reach similar downstream performance suggests self-supervision was able to
uncover fundamental information likely related to physiology.
Finally, computational requirements and architecture-specific constraints are important to
consider when choosing a pretext task. For example, being simpler, RP and TS might be preferred
over CPC if they can reach similar performance. Indeed, CPC has more hyperparameters than RP
8Exceptions would include transitions between sleep stages that are more likely than others, such as from
lighter to deeper sleep stages; however these transitions occur rarely during the night; more often a back-and-forth
between sleep stages is observed.
9PCL can be obtained by setting RP’s τ to be the length of a single window and τ to 0. Incidentally,
pos neg
we found that the optimal value of τ and τ were relatively small on the datasets considered, suggesting
pos neg
hyperparameters close to those of PCL are optimal.
23

and TS (i.e., number of context windows, of windows to be predicted and of negative examples;
architecture of the autoregressive embedder g ) and requires additional forward and backward
AR
passes through the embedder h at training time. However, CPC’s autoregressive encoder g
Θ AR
could yield better features for some tasks with larger-scale dependencies [11], e.g., sleep staging:
indeed, previous studies on deep learning for automated polysomnography have reported improved
performance using multiple consecutive windows [42] or a recurrent network on top of a window
encoder [76]. This aggregation of window-level information is already part of a CPC model and
therefore the pretrained g could be reused directly. Preliminary results (not shown) suggest
AR
these autoregressive features can substantially improve downstream performance on both the
sleep staging and pathology detection tasks.
Although the proposed tasks proved successful, many other pretext tasks could have been
designedbasedonanintuitiveunderstandingofEEG.Forinstance,atransformationdiscrimination
task was applied to ECG data in [16] and could be adapted for EEG. Similarly, nonlinear ICA-
derived frameworks such as time contrastive learning [77] and generalized contrastive learning [31]
could be used to explicitly leverage nonstationnarity or other structure present in EEG signals.
4.4 Limitations
We identify three principal limitations to this work: fixed training hyperparameters across data
regimes, restricted architecture search, and difference between reported results and state of the
art.
Deep neural networks can easily overfit the training data when few examples are available,
which can negatively impact generalization. Typical ways of addressing overfitting include
increasing the strength of regularization such as dropout and weight decay and performing early
stopping. Given the computational requirements of training neural networks on large EEG
datasets, we fixed the training hyperparameters of the fully supervised models (i.e., learning rate,
batch size, dropout, weight decay) and reused the same values across all data regimes. As a
result, the fully supervised models typically stopped learning after only a few epochs, although
they might have been able to train longer with different hyperparameters. We tested the impact
of various training hyperparameter settings on a subset of the models and saw that even though
training can be slightly improved by changing hyperparameters, this effect is not strong enough
to change any of our conclusions (results not shown).
Similarly, hyperparameter search was limited to pretext task hyperparameters in our ex-
periments. However, architecture hyperparameters (e.g., number of convolutional channels,
dimensionality of the embedding, number of layers, etc.) can also play a critical role in achieving
high performance using SSL [78]. Sticking to a single fixed architecture for all models and data
regimes means that these improvements - which could help bridge (or widen) the gap between
SSL methods and the various baselines - were not taken into account in this work.
Finally, the goal of this work being to introduce self-supervision as a representation learning
paradigm for EEG, we did not focus on matching state-of-the-art performance from earlier work
on sleep staging and pathology detection. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present
sleep staging results on PC18, and therefore there is no prior art to which our results can be
fairly compared. Nonetheless, downstream performance would most likely improve significantly
by aggregating temporal windows as was shown on other datasets [42, 76]. Similarly, on TUHab,
we chose to reuse simpler approaches from [48] instead of the best performing models. Moreover,
(1) we did not use the cropped decoding approach presented in [53], (2) we used a simpler
normalization methodology (z-score instead of exponential moving average normalization) and (3)
24

our train/validation data split was different. Together, these differences explain the small drop in
performance between these state-of-the-art methods and the results reported here.
5 Conclusion
In this work, we introduced SSL approaches to learn representations on EEG data and showed
that they could compete with and sometimes outperform traditional supervised approaches on
two large clinical tasks. Importantly, the features learned by SSL displayed a clear structure
in which different physiological quantities were jointly encoded. This validates the potential of
self-supervision to capture important physiological information even in the absence of labeled
data. Future work will have to demonstrate whether SSL can also be used successfully with
other kinds of EEG recordings and tasks, such as regression. Ultimately, developing a better
understanding of how a pretext task can be designed to target a specific kind of EEG structure
will be critical in establishing self-supervision as a key component of any EEG analysis pipeline.

The hyperparameter search in Section 3.3 was carried out using the following steps. First,
embedders h were independently trained on the RP, TS and CPC tasks. The parameters

of h were then frozen, and the different h were used as feature extractors to obtain sets of

varied the principal pretext task hyperparameters to understand their impact on both pretext and
downstream task performance (see Table 4). In both cases, we compared the balanced accuracy

vs. “across-recordings”). Again, we first varied the number of predicted windows and reused the
best value to compare negative sampling strategies.
