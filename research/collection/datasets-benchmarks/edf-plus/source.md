Introduction 

 After its introduction in 1992, the European Data Format (EDF) 

became the standard for EEG and PSG (Sleep) recordings. During

that time, several users pointed us at its limitations also for

application in other fields such as myography, evoked potentials and

cardiology.

A major limitation was that EDF can only handle uninterrupted

recordings. So we simply skipped that limitation but kept all other

specifications of

EDF intact. While maintaining EDF compatibility, we also standardized

most of the labels and added a possibility to save

annotations and analysis results. The result is EDF+ and can save most

EEG, PSG, ECG, EMG, and Evoked Potential data that can not be saved

into common hospital information systems.

 Using EDF+, all

signals, annotations and events

that are recorded in one session using one recording system can be kept

safely together in one file. EDF+ can also store events and annotations

only, without any signals. This flexibility allows the user to choose

an

optimal mix. For instance, our sleep centre stores all on-line

recorded

data (signals, annotations) in one file, its hypnogram and apnea

detections

in another EDF+ file, the same sleep scorings but made by another

technician

in a third file. In Neurophysiology, the on-line obtained raw EEG

traces

with stimulus events from an EP investigation might be stored in

one file and the averaged curves with detected latencies in a second

file.

In Cardiology, the raw ECG with annotations about the patients

exercises

can be in one file, the detected QRS parameters in another file.

 EDF+

allows storage of several NON-CONTIGUOUS recordings into one file. This

is the only incompatibility with EDF. All other

features

are EDF compatible. In fact, old EDF viewers still work and display EDF+

recordings

 as

if

 they were continuous. Therefore, we

recommend EDF+ files

 of EEG or PSG studies to be continuous if there are no good reasons for th e opposite.

 Because EDF+ is

very close to EDF, and equally

simple, EDF+ software can relatively easily be developed based on

available

EDF

software. 

 2. The

EDF+ protocol 

 Because EDF+ is

based on EDF, you should first

read the EDF specs . Section 2.1 below

describes

how EDF+ differs from EDF. Section 2.2 describes how one of the EDF+

signals

can be specially coded to store text annotations, time, events and

stimuli.

 EDF+

prescribes the following filename convention. Signals, recorded using

the

same technique and constant amplifier settings, can be stored in one

file.

Different techniques, or identical techniques but with different

amplifier

settings, must be stored in separate files. All EDF+ files must have

.edf

or .EDF as filename extension. See also section 2.3.

 2.1.

EDF+ compared to EDF 

 A standard EDF file consists of a

header

record followed by data records. The header record identifies the

patient

and specifies the technical characteristics of the recorded signals.

The

data records contain consecutive fixed-duration epochs of the recorded

signals. A standard EDF+ file also consists of a header record

followed

by data records. The structure of these records is compatible to EDF

but

contains additional specifications. Note that for your EDF+ software to

also be EDF compatible, it should support

 but not rely on these

additional specifications. 

 2.1.1.

The

EDF+ header

The EDF+ header record identifies the patient and specifies the

technical

characteristics of the recorded signals according to the EDF

specs , except for the first 'reserved' field (44 characters)

which

must start with 'EDF+C' if the recording is uninterrupted , thus

having

contiguous data records, i.e. the starttime of each data record

coincides

with the end (starttime + duration) of the preceding one. In this case,

the file is EDF compatible and the recording ends (number x duration)

seconds

after its startdate/time. The 'reserved' field must start with

'EDF+D'

if the recording is interrupted , so not all data records are

contiguous.

In both cases, the time must be kept in each data record as specified

in

 section

2.2.4 .

The only incompatibility with EDF is, that signals may be recorded

discontinuously.

Therefore, we have decided that the EDF+ 'version' field must still

read

'0 ' like in EDF. In

this way, old EDF viewers will still work and display EDF+ files

(be

they continuous or discontinuous) as continuous EDF files. EDF+

software will know the difference between continuous and discontinuous

files from the mentioned 'reserved' field. 

 2.1.2.

The EDF+ data records 

 A signal

in an EDF data record is a series of 2-byte samples, the subsequent

samples

representing subsequent integer values of that signal, sampled with

equal

time intervals. We will refer to this kind of signal as an ' ordinary

signal ' from now on. EDF+ data records can (and usually do) also

contain

ordinary signals. The EDF+ data records contain the ordinary signals

according

to the EDF specs (including the size limit

of

61440), except for the fact that the data records may unconditionally

 be

shorter than 1s, and subsequent data records need not form a

continuous

recording . However, as in EDF, data records that follow up in time

must also follow up in the file. The samples of an ordinary signal must

have equal sample intervals inside each data record, but the interval

to

the first sample of the next data record may be different.

For instance, in a motor nerve conduction study with a number of

stimuli,

each data record would hold the ordinary signals corresponding to one

stimulus.

In this case, the duration of a data record corresponds to the "window

size" in an ENMGEP study.

 Specifying a duration makes no sense if the EDF+ file does not contain any ordinary signals , for instance in a file that only contains manual sleep scores (like in both demo scoring files that come with Polyman , and the example in

3.3 ). This is also true

in the extreme case in which each ordinary signal only occupies one

sample

in each data record, while the file is discontinuous (EDF+D). In those two cases, specify the 'duration of a data record' to be 0 . 

 2.1.3.

Additional specifications

in EDF+

 1. In the header, use only printable US-ASCII

characters with byte values 32..126.

 2. The 'startdate' and 'starttime' fields

in the header should contain only characters 0-9, and the period (.) as

a separator, for example "02.08.51". In the 'startdate', use 1985 as a

clipping date in order to avoid the Y2K problem. So, the years

1985-1999

must be represented by yy=85-99 and the years 2000-2084 by yy=00-84.

After

2084, yy must be 'yy' and only item 4 of this paragraph defines the

date.

 3. The 'local patient identification' field

must start with the subfields (subfields do not contain, but are

separated

by, spaces):

 - the code by which the patient is known in

the hospital administration.

 - sex (English, so F or M).

 - birthdate in dd-MMM-yyyy format using the

English 3-character abbreviations of the month in capitals. 02-AUG-1951

is OK, while 2-AUG-1951 is not.

 - the patients name.

 Any space inside the hospital code or the

name of the patient must be replaced by a different character, for

instance

an underscore. For instance, the 'local patient identification' field

could

start with: MCH-0234567 F 02-MAY-1951 Haagse_Harry. Subfields whose

contents

are unknown, not applicable or must be made anonymous are replaced by a

single character 'X'. So, if

everything

is unknown then the 'local patient identification' field would start

with: 'X X X X'. Additional subfields may follow the ones

described

here.

 4. The 'local recording identification' field

must start with the subfields (subfields do not contain, but are

separated

by, spaces):

 - The text 'Startdate'.

 - The startdate itself in dd-MMM-yyyy format

using the English 3-character abbreviations of the month in capitals.

 - The hospital administration code of the

investigation, i.e. EEG number or PSG number.

 - A code specifying the responsible

investigator

or technician.

 - A code specifying the used equipment.

 Any space inside any of these codes must be

replaced by a different character, for instance an underscore. The

'local

recording identification' field could contain: Startdate 02-MAR-2002

PSG-1234/2002

NN Telemetry03. Subfields whose contents are unknown, not applicable or

must be made anonymous are replaced by a single character 'X'. So, if

everything

is unknown then the 'local recording identification' field would start

with: 'Startdate X X X X'. Additional subfields may follow the ones

described

here.

 5. 'Digital maximum' must be larger than

'Digital

minimum'. In case of a negative amplifier gain the corresponding

'Physical

maximum' is smaller than the 'Physical minimum'. Check item 9 on how to

apply the 'negativity upward' rule in Clinical Neurophysiology to the

physical

ordinary signal. 'Physical maximum' must differ from 'Physical

minimum'.

In case of uncalibrated signals, physical dimension is left empty (that

is 8 spaces), while 'Physical maximum' and 'Physical minimum' must

still

contain different values (this is to avoid 'division by 0' errors by

some

viewers).

 6. Never use any digit grouping symbol

in numbers. Never use a comma "," for a for a decimal separator. When a

decimal separator is required, use a dot (".").

 7. The ordinary signal samples (2-byte two's

complement integers) must be stored in 'little-endian' format, that is

the least significant byte first. This is the default format in PC applications. 

 8. The 'starttime' should be local time at

the patients location when the recording was started.

 9. Use the standard texts and polarity rules

at http://www.edfplus.info/specs/edftexts.html .

These standard texts may in the future be extended with further texts,

a.o. for Sleep scorings, ENG and various evoked potentials.

 10. The 'number of data records' can only

be -1 during recording. As soon as the file is closed, the correct

number

is known and must be entered.

 11. If filters (such as HighPass, LowPass

or Notch) were applied to the ordinary signals then, preferably

automatically,

specify them like "HP:0.1Hz LP:75Hz N:50Hz" in the "prefiltering" field

of the header. If the file contains an analysis result, the

prefiltering

field should mention the relevant analysis parameters.

 12. The "transducertype" field should specify

the applied sensor, such as "AgAgCl electrode" or "thermistor".

 2.2.

Annotations for text, time-keeping, events and stimuli 

 This section

describes how one of the EDF+

signals can be specially coded to store text annotations, time, events

and stimuli. In this way, annotations and events are kept in the same

file

as the signals that they refer to. The coding is EDF compatible in the

sense that old EDF software would simply treat this 'EDF Annotations'

signal

as if it were a (strange-looking) ordinary signal.

 2.2.1. The

'EDF Annotations' signal

 EDF+ data records can (and often do) contain

ordinary signals. EDF+ introduces one other kind of signal, in which

the

values are annotations that can occur at any arbitrary point of time.

This

signal is identified by giving it (in the EDF+ header) the label 'EDF

Annotations'.

As in EDF, the ' nr of samples in each data record '

field in the header

specifies how many 2-byte integers this 'EDF Annotations' signal

occupies in each datarecord.

But instead of storing 'ordinary signal' samples, those 2-byte integers

are filled with characters. The character-bytes are stored

byte-by-byte

without changing their order. For instance, the text 'abc' is

represented

by successive byte values 97, 98 and 99 in the 'EDF Annotations'

signal.

Even if no annotations are to be kept, an EDF+ file must contain at

least one 'EDF Annotations' signal in order to specify the starttime of

each datarecord (see section

2.2.4). Of course, the label 'EDF Annotations' is not allowed for

ordinary

signals.

 The 'EDF

Annotations' signal only has meaningful header fields 'label' and 'nr

of

samples in each data record'. For the sake of EDF compatibility, the

fields

'digital minimum' and 'digital maximum' must be filled with -32768 and

32767, respectively. The 'Physical maximum' and 'Physical minimum'

fields

must contain values that differ from each other. The other fields of

this

signal are filled with spaces. 

 2.2.2. Time-stamped Annotations

Lists (TALs) in an 'EDF Annotations' signal

 Text, time-keeping, events and stimuli are

coded as text annotations in this 'EDF Annotations' signal. The

annotations

are listed in Time-stamped Annotations Lists (TALs) as follows.

Each TAL starts with a time stamp Onset Duration 

in which 

and 

are single bytes with value 21 and 20, respectively (unprintable ASCII

characters) and Onset as well as Duration are coded using US-ASCII

characters

with byte values 43, 45, 46 and 48-57 (the '+', '-', '.' and

'0'-'9'

characters, respectively). Onset must start with a '+' or a '-'

character

and specifies the amount of seconds by which the onset of the annotated

event follows ('+') or precedes ('-') the startdate/time of the file,

that

is specified in the header. Duration must not contain any '+' or '-'

and

specifies the duration of the annotated event in seconds. If such a

specification

is not relevant, Duration can be skipped in which case its

preceding 

must also be skipped. Both Onset and Duration can contain a dot ('.')

but

only if the fraction of a second is specified (up to arbitrary

accuracy).

After the time stamp, a list of annotations all sharing the same Onset

and Duration may follow. Each annotation is followed by a single 

and may not contain any .

A -byte (the

unprintable

ASCII character with byte value 0) follows after the last 

of this TAL. So the TAL ends with a 

followed by a .

In each data record, the first TAL must start at the first byte of the

'EDF Annotations signal'. Subsequent TALs in the same data record must

follow immediately after the trailing 

of the preceding TAL. A TAL, including its trailing ,

may not overflow into another data record. Each event is annotated only

once, even if its duration makes it extend into the time period of

other

data records. Unused bytes of the 'EDF Annotations' signal in the

remainder

of the data record are also filled with -bytes.

Additional 'EDF Annotations' signals may be defined according to the

same

specification.

 For example, if

the technician switches off the lights and closes the door 3 minutes

after

startdate/time, this can be stored as the 28-bytes TAL '+180 Lights

off Close door '

without the quotes. Alternatively, the two events can be stored as two

separate shorter TALs '+180 Lights

off +180 Close

door ',

also without the quotes. The TAL '+1800.2 25.5 Apnea '

codes a 25.5s apnea that begins 30 minutes and 0.2s after starttime. 

 2.2.3. Annotations

in a TAL

 The part between 

and the next is

called

one annotation. These annotations may only contain UCS characters (ISO

10646, the 'Universal Character Set', which is identical to the Unicode 

version 3+ character set) encoded by UTF-8 .

This encoding is supported by the major operating systems, compilers

and

applications. The first 127 UCS characters are identical to those in

US-ASCII

and are encoded in the corresponding single byte values. US-ASCII

characters

that are represented by byte values 0-31 are allowed in the annotations

only if explicitly prescribed by this EDF+ protocol. In order to enable

multi-line texts and tables, US-ASCII characters that are represented

by

byte values 9 (TAB), 10 (LF) and 13 (CR) are allowed in the

annotations.

The first 65534 characters (the Basic Multilingual Plane: BMP) of the

UCS

contain virtually all characters used in any language in the world

including

Asian languages and UTF-8 encodes these in up to three byte-values.

Remember

that this encoding applies to the 'EDF Annotations' signal only: in the

EDF+ header, only US-ASCII characters with byte values 32..126

are

allowed.

In order to support automatic averaging and superimposition, identical

events or stimuli that occur several times in one file must be coded

each

time by the same, unique annotation. Annotations (the part between 

and the next )

of

different events/stimuli (or the same stimulus at a different

location)

must differ from this unique annotation.

Annotations, for instance stimuli, that are related to information in

only

one particular data record, must be in that same data record. Even

annotations

describing events preceding the start of that data record, for instance

a pre-interval stimulus must

 follow the time-keeping annotation. 

 2.2.4. Time keeping

of data records

 Because data records need not be contiguous,

the starttime of each data record must be specified in another way. So,

the first annotation of the first 'EDF Annotations'

signal

in each data record is empty, but its timestamp specifies how many

seconds

after the filestartdate/time that data record starts. So, if the first

TAL in a data record reads '+567 ',

then that data record starts 567s after the startdate/time of the file.

If the data records contain 'ordinary signals', then the starttime of

each

data record must be the starttime of its signals. If there are no

'ordinary

signals', then a non-empty annotation immediately following the

time-keeping

annotation (in the same TAL) must specify what event defines the

starttime

of this data record. For example, '+3456.789 R-wave 

indicates that this data record starts at the occurrence of an R-wave,

which is 3456.789s after file start.

The startdate/time of a file is specified in the EDF+ header fields

'startdate

of recording' and 'starttime of recording'. These fields must indicate

the absolute second in which the start of the first data record falls.

So, the first TAL in the first data record always starts with

+0.X ,

indicating that the first data record starts a fraction, X, of a second

after the startdate/time that is specified in the EDF+ header. If X=0,

then the .X may be omitted. 

 2.3. Analysis results in

EDF+ 

 Ideally, all

data (signals, annotations, events)

recorded in one session using one recording system are in one EDF+

file.

Data from the same patient but from other sessions or equipment will

usually

be kept in separate files. Ideally, all these files have an identical

'Patient

identification' field. In this way, accurate synchronicity between

signals

and events is kept within the files and it is exactly known to what

period

in which patients life the data apply.

In practice, this will not always be possible. However, it �s

easy

to maintain synchronicity and patient identification between a

recording

and data that are derived from that recording. Such derived data can be

analysis results such as averages, QRS parameters, peak latencies or

sleep

stages or simply a subset of the recording. If such analysis results

are

stored in EDF+ then this must be done as follows.

If the original recording is in file R.edf (R can be any string), then

the derived-file name must be RA.edf in which A can be any string. For

instance a PSG would be recorded in file PSG0123_2002.edf and its sleep

stage analysis in PSG0123_2002_hyp.edf. Copy the patient-id line

(80

characters) from the recorded file into the analysis file. 

Make sure that startdate, starttime, and number and duration of

datarecords,

are correct. So, if the analysis contains a period from 01:05:00 till

01:25:00

of a 24-hour recording that was started on August 2, 1999, 23:00:00hr,

then the analysis file should have startdate 03.08.99 and starttime

01.05.00.

In this way it is clear that both files refer to one and the same time

period in the patient's life. Some viewers (like PolyMan) are then

capable

of showing the two (or more) files time-synchronized on one screen.

Because

the analysis may reduce or increase the amount of data, the durations

of

analysis-file data records and recording-file data records may differ.

Apply suitable scaling factors in such a way that a large part of the

available

range of -32768 till 32767 for the values of the analysis results is

used.

If necessary, the scaling factor can be adapted to the dynamic range of

the analysis result even after the analysis was done. Put these scaling

factors in the header (digital and physical minimum and maximum) of the

analysis file. If such scaling is really impossible because the useful

dynamic range of the analysis result is too large, but only then, apply

the standardized logarithmic transformation 

to store floating point values. Be aware that old EDF software is not

aware

of this transformation, and will show the analysis results on a

logarithmic

scale. So really try scaling first!

If a hypnogram is stored as an ordinary signal, sleep stages

W,1,2,3,4,R,M

should be coded in the data records as the integer numbers

0,1,2,3,4,5,6

respectively. Unscored epochs should be coded as the integer number 9.

If a hypnogram is stored as annotations, use the standard

texts .

Automatically document the analysis principle and parameters in the

Recording-id

and, in case of ordinary signals, also in Label, Transducer type,

Physical

dimension and Prefiltering fields in the header of the analysis file.

 3.

Some

examples 

 3.1. Auditory

EP recording

 The following is an example of annotations

in the first two data records of an auditory EP recording. Each data

record

has two TALs, the first one includes the (mandatory) time-keeping

annotation,

the second one specifies a pre-interval stimulus. 

 +0 Stimulus

click 35dB both ears Free

text 

 -0.065 Pre-stimulus

beep 1000Hz | 

 +0.3 Stimulus

click 35dB both ears 

 +0.235 Pre-stimulus

beep 1000Hz | 

 In this example,

averaging can be triggered by

the unique texts "Stimulus click 35dB both ears" and/or "Pre-stimulus

beep

1000Hz". 

 3.2. Sleep recording (PSG) with MSLT 

A PSG that is followed by an MSLT can be stored in separate files. The

PSG file, including lights-off and

final

wake-up annotations, is a continuous EDF+ file. The MSLT is a

discontinuous EDF+ file which contains only the

20-minute

periods in bed. Alternatively, the PSG and the MSLT can also be stored

together into one single (discontinuous) file. 

 3.3.

Sleep scoring

 A 8-24hr sleep recording takes about 30-300MB

when stored in EDF+. The recording can be analyzed manually, resulting

in apnea's, leg movements and sleep stages. These results are kept in a

separate EDF+ file (about 10-100kB) which, in this example, only

contains

one data record with one 'EDF Annotations' signal and no 'ordinary'

signals.

The table below shows the first half hour and the last few minutes in

this

data record. This patient fell asleep 9 minutes after switching off the

light and had limb movements (Right and/or Left leg) and apneas after

reaching

sleep stage 2 and 3, respectively. If another technician also scores

apnea's,

leg movements or sleep stages, these scorings can be kept in another

separate

EDF+ file.

 3.4. A large neurophysiological session 

 The

example session includes the following investigations that are stored

in separate

EDF+

files. Note that the EDF+ processing software must implement any

'negativity

upward' rule after reading the signal from the file. See further label

and polarity rules at http://www.edfplus.info/specs/edftexts.html .

 A

 continuous EMG 

is stored in a file with two

signals:

the raw EMG and the obligatory 'EDF Annotations'

signal.

This is a 'continuous' EDF+ file, so the recording might alternatively

be stored as an EDF file. In case of a concentric needle electrode

recording,

a positivity at the centrally insulated wire relative to the cannula of

the needle is stored as a positive value in the file.

 An

 F response 

is also stored in a file with the raw EMG and the annotations. The

duration of a data

record equals the duration of the investigator's screen, i.e. of the

'window'

(e.g. 50 ms). Each data

record contains one single response. The annotations describe timing

and any further characteristics of the

stimulus.

They can also describe measured distances and latencies.

 A

 Motor

Nerve Conduction Velocity with one EMG channel is also stored in a file with the raw EMG and the

annotations.

The duration of a data record equals the duration of the 'window'. The

curves from wrist and elbow stimulation are stored in the first and the

second data record, respectively. The annotations describe

timing and further characteristics of the stimulus. They can also

describe measured

distances

and latencies. This file is described in full detail below.

 A

 Somatosensory Evoked

Potential with four recorded signals is stored in a file with five

signals: the four raw SSEP signals and one 'EDF

Annotations'

signal. The duration of a data record equals the duration of the window

(e.g. 100 ms). The annotations describe timing and characteristics of

the

stimulus. Another EDF+ file contains

the 4-channel averaged responses (averages of odd and even sweeps are

kept

in different data records) and the 'EDF Annotations' signal which

stores

stimulus characteristics and measured latencies.

 A

 Visual Evoked Potential 

is investigated by recording two sagittal EEG signals during

checkerboard

stimulation of the left and right field, respectively.

The left- and right-stimulated averages are

stored in two separate files.

Left and right investigations are repeated once for checking

reproducibility,

so both files contain two data records. Each data record lasts 300ms

and

contains three signals: two EEG averages and the EDF Annotations. The

annotations

describe stimulus characteristics and measured latencies. The signal

sampling

starts 10ms before each stimulus, so the first two TALs in the 'left'

file

is 0.000 

 and 0.010 Stimulus

checkerboard left . 

 3.5. Intra-operative monitoring 

Four

(left and right) signals with alternating right and left stimulus are

monitored. In

this

case, left and right stimulation affect correspondingly lateralized

signals.

So, the recording can be stored in two ('left' and 'right') EDF+ files.

Each file contains 4 electrophysiological signals and 1 'EDF

Annotations'

signal. Alternatively, if sufficient amplifiers are available, the

recording

can be stored in one file containing 9

signals

(4 'left' and 4 'right' electrophysiological signals and 1 'EDF

Annotations'

signal). In both cases, the response to each stimulus is stored in a

separate

data record and the 'EDF Annotations' signal specifies timing and

characteristics

of the stimulus (a.o. whether it is left or right). 

 3.6. Routine EEG 

The 10/20 system electrodes (for instance F3, C3, T3, Cz

and O1 and so on) are recorded against

a common

reference and saved as such in the EDF+ file. Therefore the montages can be made during review, such

as F3-C3, T3-C3, C3-Cz and C3-O1. Because

electrode

locations are specified using standard

texts , re-montaging (i.e. re-referencing) EEG derivations can be

done

automatically. The Annotations signal contains events such as 'Eyes Closed' or 'Hyperventilation'. 

 3.7.

The Motor Nerve Conduction file 

 A right Median

Nerve conduction velocity is

investigated by recording the right Abductor Pollicis Brevis while

stimuli

are given at wrist and elbow. The averaged signal and the corresponding

annotations are stored in two data records: one for wrist and the other

for elbow stimulation.

 Each data record

contains: 

 1000 * 2-byte integer : R APB samples

 60 * 2-byte integer : EDF Annotations 

 The EDF Annotations signal

in the 1st data record contains one TAL and is then filled out

with -bytes

until the end. The TAL is:

 +0 Stimulus

right wrist 0.2ms x 8.2mA at 6.5cm from recording site Response

7.2mV at 3.8ms | 

The EDF

Annotations signal in the 2nd data

record also contains one TAL: 

 +10 Stimulus

right elbow 0.2ms x 15.3mA at 28.5cm from recording site Response

7.2mV at 7.8ms (55.0m/s) | 

 In this

example, the TALs take less than 100

characters per data record, so the header reserves 120 characters (60

'samples')

for the EDF Annotations signal.

 If desired, an

internal structure of the annotations

inside a TAL can be chosen. This is not obligatory, usually increases

size,

does not improve exchange to other systems, but can be useful locally.

For example, the last TAL can be coded as four separate TALs and the

annotation

inside each TAL can be coded in XML 

as follows:
